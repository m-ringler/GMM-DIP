               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract____leo05">In the present work a new dye, [Ru(dcbpyH2)2(bpy-TPA2)](PF6)2, and the well-known (Bu4N)2[Ru(dcbpyH)2(NCS)2] complex were
                  investigated. The electronic transitions of both dyes showed solvatochromic shifts due to specific interactions of the ligands
                  with the solvent molecules. The surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectra of the dyes dissolved in water, ethanol, and acetonitrile
                  were measured in silver and gold colloidal solutions. The results demonstrate that the dyes were adsorbed on the metallic
                  nanoparticles in different ways for different solvents. It was also found that in the gold colloid, the aqueous solutions
                  of both dyes did not produce any SERS signal, whereas in ethanolic solution the SERS effect was very weak. Deprotonation,
                  H-bonding, and donor-acceptor interactions seem to determine these different behaviors. Our results indicate the important
                  role of the charge-transfer mechanism in SERS.

                  id="abstract__nd_harmonic_generation_kel03">The optical properties of metal nanoparticles have long been of interest in physical chemistry, starting with Faraday's investigations
                  of colloidal gold in the middle 1800s. More recently, new lithographic techniques as well as improvements to classical wet
                  chemistry methods have made it possible to synthesize noble metal nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes, shapes, and dielectric
                  environments. In this feature article, we describe recent progress in the theory of nanoparticle optical properties, particularly
                  methods for solving Maxwell's equations for light scattering from particles of arbitrary shape in a complex environment. Included
                  is a description of the qualitative features of dipole and quadrupole plasmon resonances for spherical particles; a discussion
                  of analytical and numerical methods for calculating extinction and scattering cross-sections, local fields, and other optical
                  properties for nonspherical particles; and a survey of applications to problems of recent interest involving triangular silver
                  particles and related shapes.

                  investigated. The electronic transitions of both dyes showed solvatochromic shifts due to specific interactions of the ligands
                  with the solvent molecules. The surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectra of the dyes dissolved in water, ethanol, and acetonitrile
                  were measured in silver and gold colloidal solutions. The results demonstrate that the dyes were adsorbed on the metallic
                  nanoparticles in different ways for different solvents. It was also found that in the gold colloid, the aqueous solutions
                  of both dyes did not produce any SERS signal, whereas in ethanolic solution the SERS effect was very weak. Deprotonation,
                  H-bonding, and donor-acceptor interactions seem to determine these different behaviors. Our results indicate the important
                  role of the charge-transfer mechanism in SERS.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_AFM_suh03">We have studied the laser-excitation-intensity-dependent and Ag-nanocluster interstitial-site-dependent SERS intensity fluctuations
                  under low molecule surface coverage of rhodamine 6G and cytochrome c. A new two-channel photon time-stamping system coupled
                  with atomic force microscopic (AFM), Raman spectroscopic, and imaging microscopy was developed and applied to record Raman
                  intensity fluctuation trajectories at sub-microsecond resolution correlated with in situ characterization of the nanoparticle
                  clusters. Our experimental results suggest that the nanoconfinement of the local electromagnetic-field enhancement and the
                  interaction of the local field with the molecules, presumably under rotational motions, result in nano-Raman fluctuations.
                  The SERS spectral fluctuation was pertinent to the nanoscale local enhancement and local interaction of the molecules with
                  the surface when the surface coverage of the nanoparticles was less than a monolayer, and the nanoscale interstitial space
                  controlled the finite number of molecules to contribute the microscopic Raman signal collected from a diffraction-limited
                  focus spot. The fluctuation amplitude significantly decreased with the number of molecules confined at the nanolocal field.
                  The nano-SERS fluctuation dynamics were both photo-induced and spontaneous for rhodamine 6G, but only the photo-induced component
                  was observable for cytochrome c. The fluctuation dynamics were also found to be highly inhomogeneous at interstitial sites
                  with heterogeneous geometries. To interpret the observed nano-SERS fluctuation dynamics, we used computer simulation of optical
                  multiple scattering, based on multi-sphere scattering Mie theory, and rotational diffusion of molecules at an interstitial
                  site, based on a random walk in orientation space.

                  (QED). In addition to demonstrating dramatic changes in spontaneous emission, cavity QED has led to the creation of new kinds
                  of microscopic masers that operate with a single atom and a few photons or with photons emitted in pairs in a two-photon transition.
                  The influence of boundary conditions on atomic radiation was pointed out long ago, and a considerable body of literature exists
                  on the subject. Until recently, however, experimental evidence for these effects had been scarce because of the difficulties
                  of preparing, controlling and observing the emission of isolated atoms or molecules near surfaces. Just as a cavity below
                  cutoff suppresses vacuum fluctuations, a resonance cavity enhances them. In addition to changing the radiation rate of atoms,
                  atom-cavity coupling also includes energy shifts. This phenomenon can be understood as a frequency-pulling effect t

                  and functional materials. The preparation and resulting properties of two- and three-dimensional arrays of nanoparticles are
                  detailed, and some potential uses for these materials are discussed. Although many types of nanoparticles can be organized
                  into such structures, this review focuses specifically on Au and CdE (E=S, Se) nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles are easily
                  prepared, highly stable, well-studied, and excellent models for other metal colloids. CdE colloids are the most extensively
                  studied semiconductor nanoparticles and hold much promise in the optoelectronics field.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Aggregates_suh03">We have studied the laser-excitation-intensity-dependent and Ag-nanocluster interstitial-site-dependent SERS intensity fluctuations
                  under low molecule surface coverage of rhodamine 6G and cytochrome c. A new two-channel photon time-stamping system coupled
                  with atomic force microscopic (AFM), Raman spectroscopic, and imaging microscopy was developed and applied to record Raman
                  intensity fluctuation trajectories at sub-microsecond resolution correlated with in situ characterization of the nanoparticle
                  clusters. Our experimental results suggest that the nanoconfinement of the local electromagnetic-field enhancement and the
                  interaction of the local field with the molecules, presumably under rotational motions, result in nano-Raman fluctuations.
                  The SERS spectral fluctuation was pertinent to the nanoscale local enhancement and local interaction of the molecules with
                  the surface when the surface coverage of the nanoparticles was less than a monolayer, and the nanoscale interstitial space
                  controlled the finite number of molecules to contribute the microscopic Raman signal collected from a diffraction-limited
                  focus spot. The fluctuation amplitude significantly decreased with the number of molecules confined at the nanolocal field.
                  The nano-SERS fluctuation dynamics were both photo-induced and spontaneous for rhodamine 6G, but only the photo-induced component
                  was observable for cytochrome c. The fluctuation dynamics were also found to be highly inhomogeneous at interstitial sites
                  with heterogeneous geometries. To interpret the observed nano-SERS fluctuation dynamics, we used computer simulation of optical
                  multiple scattering, based on multi-sphere scattering Mie theory, and rotational diffusion of molecules at an interstitial
                  site, based on a random walk in orientation space.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_BSA_grd02">The secondary structure of bovine serum albumin (BSA) is determined from infrared spectra (cast films, solution in phosphate
                  buffer) by analyzing the structure of Amide bands. Due to strong overlapping of intrinsic bands three classical methods of
                  band decomposition was implemented: Fourier self deconvolution, second derivatives and band fitting algorithm. The initial
                  values for the number of the components and their position was checked with a novel procedure of dry and hydrated H/D exchange.
                  The most dominant band component in Amide I region is the band at 1654 cm-1, which is usually attributed to a-helical structure.
                  Other bands in Amide I region are attributed to various type of turns. Hydration of protein, as well as the solvation of protein
                  in phosphate buffer, induces the radical change in the secondary structure, especially in the population of a-helices. Drying
                  of the protein film causes a partial denaturation. Classical methods for determine the changes in secondary structure are
                  not accurate enough. Moreover, the interpretation of changes can be easily misleading. Hence, the difference spectroscopy
                  was used to clarify the effects of hydration and solvation on the protein secondary structure. The solvated protein was measured
                  in ATR cell. For proper compare the ATR spectrum with the normal transmission one, first optical constant n and k were calculated
                  and later the exact absorption spectrum.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_CCD_image_sensors_soe00">We have developed a simple, fast, and flexible technique to measure optical scattering spectra of individual metallic nanoparticles.
                  The particles are placed in an evanescent field produced by total internal reflection of light from a halogen lamp in a glass
                  prism. The light scattered by individual particles is collected using a conventional microscope and is spectrally analyzed
                  by a nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled-device array coupled to a spectrometer. This technique is employed to measure the effect
                  of particle diameter on the dephasing time of the particle plasmon resonance in gold nanoparticles. We also demonstrate the
                  use of this technique for measurements in liquids, which is important for the potential application of particle plasmons in
                  chemical or biological nanosensors.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_DNA_gue04">We report the study of the quenching of quantum dots (CdSe) by gold nanoparticles at the single-molecule level. Double-stranded
                  DNA is used as a rigid spacer to tune the distance between the two nanoparticles. The width of the fluorescent intensity distribution,
                  monitored at different interparticle distances, reflects both the nanoparticle heterogeneity and the fluorescence intermittency
                  of the quantum dot. The fluorescence distribution emitted by single CdSe nanocrystals can easily be distinguished from the
                  fluorescence of partially quenched CdSe. Our results show that the distance-dependence quenching is compatible with a FÃ¶rster-type
                  process.

                  and rate equation formalisms, we show that, for surface coverages at which the surface immobilized molecules interact, barriers
                  to penetration create a distribution of target molecule concentrations within the adsorbed layer. By approximately enumerating
                  probe and target conformations, we estimate the probability of overlap between complementary probe and target regions as a
                  function of probe density and chain length. In agreement with experiments, we find that as probe molecules interact more strongly,
                  fewer nucleation sites become accessible and binding rates are diminished relative to those in solution. Nucleation sites
                  near the grafted end of the probes are least accessible; thus targets which preferentially bind to this region show more drastic
                  rate reductions than those that bind near the free end of the probe. The implications of these results for DNA-based biosensors
                  are discussed.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_DNA_sto97">In this review, we focus on some of the most successful approaches to date for organizing nanoparticles into macroscopic aggregates
                  and functional materials. The preparation and resulting properties of two- and three-dimensional arrays of nanoparticles are
                  detailed, and some potential uses for these materials are discussed. Although many types of nanoparticles can be organized
                  into such structures, this review focuses specifically on Au and CdE (E=S, Se) nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles are easily
                  prepared, highly stable, well-studied, and excellent models for other metal colloids. CdE colloids are the most extensively
                  studied semiconductor nanoparticles and hold much promise in the optoelectronics field.

                  in aqueous solution from ensemble measurements and at the single molecule level. The donor dyes: tetramethylrhodamine (TMR);
                  rhodamine 6G (R6G); and a carbocyanine dye (Cy3) were covalently attached to the 5?-end of a 40-mer model oligonucleotide.
                  The acceptor dyes, a carbocyanine dye (Cy5), and a rhodamine derivative (JA133) were attached at modified thymidine bases
                  in the complementary DNA strand with donor-acceptor distances of 5, 15, 25 and 35 DNA-bases, respectively. Anisotropy measurements
                  demonstrate that none of the dyes can be observed as a free rotor; especially in the 5-bp constructs the dyes exhibit relatively
                  high anisotropy values. Nevertheless, the dyes change their conformation with respect to the oligonucleotide on a slower time
                  scale in the millisecond range. This results in a dynamic inhomogeneous distribution of donor/acceptor (D/A) distances and
                  orientations. FRET efficiencies have been calculated from donor and acceptor fluorescence intensity as well as from time-resolved
                  fluorescence measurements of the donor fluorescence decay. Dependent on the D/A pair and distance, additional strong fluorescence
                  quenching of the donor is observed, which simulates lower FRET efficiencies at short distances and higher efficiencies at
                  longer distances. On the other hand, spFRET measurements revealed subpopulations that exhibit the expected FRET efficiency,
                  even at short D/A distances. In addition, the measured acceptor fluorescence intensities and lifetimes also partly show fluorescence
                  quenching effects independent of the excitation wavelength, i.e. either directly excited or via FRET. These effects strongly
                  depend on the D/A distance and the dyes used, respectively. The obtained data demonstrate that besides dimerization at short
                  D/A distances, an electron transfer process between the acceptor Cy5 and rhodamine donors has to be taken into account. To
                  explain deviations from FRET theory even at larger D/A distances, we suggest that the -stack of the DNA double helix mediates
                  electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor, even over distances as long as 35 base pairs. Our data show that FRET experiments
                  at the single molecule level are rather suited to resolve fluorescent subpopulations in heterogeneous mixture, information
                  about strongly quenched subpopulations gets lost.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_DNA_bases_nor97">The increased sensitivity and the advantage of new lopw-cost optical sources and detectros in the red region creates a great
                  demand for new efficient fluorescence labels in this wavelength region. Here some problems arise due to the fact that with
                  increasing absorption wavelength the fluorescence quantum yield drastically decreases, especially in aqueous media. Additionally,
                  organic dyes may aggregate and show non-specific agginities to biological materials. We investigate the interactions of recently
                  developed fluorescent dyes and two commercially available fluorescent dyes with the DNA base guanosine. The results obtained
                  in intermolecular quenching experiments reveal various fluorescence quenching effects. Due to the increasing hydrophobicity
                  of fluorescent dyes with increasing molecular size the aggregation tendency with biological materials also increases. Therefore
                  ground and excited state interactions increase thus promoting the observed fluorescence quenching.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Diffraction_gratings_mor02">Highly accurate computations of surface plasmons in metallic nanostructures with various geometries are presented. Calculations
                  for cylinders with irregular cross section, coupled structures, and periodic gratings are shown. These systems exhibit a resonant
                  behavior with complex field distribution and strong field enhancement, and therefore their computation requires a very accurate
                  numerical method. It is shown that the multiple multipole (MMP) method, together with an automatic multipole setting (AMS)
                  procedure, is well suited for these computations. An AMS technique for the two-dimensional MMP method is presented. It relies
                  on the global topology of each domain boundary to generate a distribution of numerically independent multipole expansions.
                  This technique greatly facilitates the MMP modeling.

                  id="abstract_Dye_nucleotide_interactions_wid97">The feasibility of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) for the monitoring of fast kinetic processes has been investigated.
                  The interaction between Rh6G and different nucleotides in water served as a model system. Following the fluorescence fluctuations
                  arising due to dye-nucleotide interactions around an unperturbed equilibrium it is possible to retrieve information about
                  association and dissociation kinetics of the different electronic states involved in the fluorescence generation. No macroscopic
                  perturbation of thermodynamic parameters, as in chemical relaxation experiments, is needed. Compared to other fluorescence
                  techniques used to study interactions of this kind, such as flash photolysis, FCS requires a very simple instrumentation.
                  A very broad time interval can be covered and the fact that FCS is based on a fluorescence microscope allows for kinetic studies
                  on a microscopic scale. Hence, FCS can be used in parallel or as an alternative to more established fluorescence techniques
                  providing a simple and easy-to-use tool by which similar and complementary information on kinetic processes can be obtained.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Fluorescence_car06">We study the spontaneous emission of a single emitter close to a metallic nanoparticle, with the aim to clarify the distance
                  dependence of the radiative and non-radiative decay rates. We derive analytical formulas based on a dipole-dipole model, and
                  show that the non-radiative decay rate follows a R-6 dependence at short distance, where R is the distance between the emitter
                  and the center of the nanoparticle, as in Forster's energy transfer. The distance dependence of the radiative decay rate is
                  more subtle. It is chiefly dominated by a R-3 dependence, a R-6 dependence being visible at plasmon resonance. The latter
                  is a consequence of radiative damping in the effective dipole polarizability of the nanoparticle. The different distance behavior
                  of the radiative and non-radiative decay rates implies that the apparent quantum yield always vanishes at short distance.
                  Moreover, non-radiative decay is strongly enhanced when the emitter radiates at the plasmon-resonance frequency of the nanoparticle.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Fluorescence_hae07">Near-field coupling of a single gold nanoparticle (GNP) to a single fluorescent molecule is investigated here for varying
                  separation d between the two. While the emission quantum efficiency of the coupled system generally decreases for d!0, a pronounced
                  near-field enhancement is observed under certain conditions, partly outweighing the efficiency loss at small distances. We
                  report on optimizing these conditions by varying the excitation field direction and the three-dimensional relative configuration
                  between the GNP and the fluorophore. Furthermore, we examine how the sphere diameter, the surrounding medium, as well as the
                  absorption and emission wavelengths of the molecular dipole influence the fluorescence yield. Our results are of high practical
                  relevance for all GNP-mediated application fields such as fluorescence microscopy, scattering near-field optical microscopy,

                  and photophysical properties have been compared to those of the corresponding two-dimensional system of self-assembled monolayers
                  (SAMs) of the porphyrin as well as the bis(porphyrin) disulfide reference in solutions. In particular, the time-resolved single-photon

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Fluorescence_lie97">With the introduction of different quenching moieties in already existing rhodamine dyes we were able to develop new dyes
                  with nearly identical absorption and emission characteristics but different fluorescent lifetimes and quantum yields, so called
                  multiplex dyes. Optical excitation of the rhodamine chromophor induces an intramolecular electron transfer between the rhodamine
                  subunit and the quenching molecule. As predicted by the classical theory of electron transfer we can control the rate of electron
                  transfer by the distance between the donor and the acceptor, e.g. different coupling positions and spacers, and the polarity
                  of the surrounding medium. We investigated the following quenchers: m-, o- and p-nitrobenzylamine, p-dimethylaminobenzylamine

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Fluorescence_nor97">The increased sensitivity and the advantage of new lopw-cost optical sources and detectros in the red region creates a great
                  demand for new efficient fluorescence labels in this wavelength region. Here some problems arise due to the fact that with
                  increasing absorption wavelength the fluorescence quantum yield drastically decreases, especially in aqueous media. Additionally,
                  organic dyes may aggregate and show non-specific agginities to biological materials. We investigate the interactions of recently
                  developed fluorescent dyes and two commercially available fluorescent dyes with the DNA base guanosine. The results obtained
                  in intermolecular quenching experiments reveal various fluorescence quenching effects. Due to the increasing hydrophobicity
                  of fluorescent dyes with increasing molecular size the aggregation tendency with biological materials also increases. Therefore
                  ground and excited state interactions increase thus promoting the observed fluorescence quenching.

                  The interaction between Rh6G and different nucleotides in water served as a model system. Following the fluorescence fluctuations
                  arising due to dye-nucleotide interactions around an unperturbed equilibrium it is possible to retrieve information about
                  association and dissociation kinetics of the different electronic states involved in the fluorescence generation. No macroscopic
                  perturbation of thermodynamic parameters, as in chemical relaxation experiments, is needed. Compared to other fluorescence
                  techniques used to study interactions of this kind, such as flash photolysis, FCS requires a very simple instrumentation.
                  A very broad time interval can be covered and the fact that FCS is based on a fluorescence microscope allows for kinetic studies
                  on a microscopic scale. Hence, FCS can be used in parallel or as an alternative to more established fluorescence techniques
                  providing a simple and easy-to-use tool by which similar and complementary information on kinetic processes can be obtained.

                  in aqueous solution from ensemble measurements and at the single molecule level. The donor dyes: tetramethylrhodamine (TMR);
                  rhodamine 6G (R6G); and a carbocyanine dye (Cy3) were covalently attached to the 5?-end of a 40-mer model oligonucleotide.
                  The acceptor dyes, a carbocyanine dye (Cy5), and a rhodamine derivative (JA133) were attached at modified thymidine bases
                  in the complementary DNA strand with donor-acceptor distances of 5, 15, 25 and 35 DNA-bases, respectively. Anisotropy measurements
                  demonstrate that none of the dyes can be observed as a free rotor; especially in the 5-bp constructs the dyes exhibit relatively
                  high anisotropy values. Nevertheless, the dyes change their conformation with respect to the oligonucleotide on a slower time
                  scale in the millisecond range. This results in a dynamic inhomogeneous distribution of donor/acceptor (D/A) distances and
                  orientations. FRET efficiencies have been calculated from donor and acceptor fluorescence intensity as well as from time-resolved
                  fluorescence measurements of the donor fluorescence decay. Dependent on the D/A pair and distance, additional strong fluorescence
                  quenching of the donor is observed, which simulates lower FRET efficiencies at short distances and higher efficiencies at
                  longer distances. On the other hand, spFRET measurements revealed subpopulations that exhibit the expected FRET efficiency,
                  even at short D/A distances. In addition, the measured acceptor fluorescence intensities and lifetimes also partly show fluorescence
                  quenching effects independent of the excitation wavelength, i.e. either directly excited or via FRET. These effects strongly
                  depend on the D/A distance and the dyes used, respectively. The obtained data demonstrate that besides dimerization at short
                  D/A distances, an electron transfer process between the acceptor Cy5 and rhodamine donors has to be taken into account. To
                  explain deviations from FRET theory even at larger D/A distances, we suggest that the -stack of the DNA double helix mediates
                  electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor, even over distances as long as 35 base pairs. Our data show that FRET experiments
                  at the single molecule level are rather suited to resolve fluorescent subpopulations in heterogeneous mixture, information
                  about strongly quenched subpopulations gets lost.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Gel_media_rig97">Some unique events have occurred in the last few years which might revolutionize the field of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
                  While it was widely recognized that such matrices could normally be cast with a small pore size distribution, typically of
                  the order of a few nanometers diameter (for protein sieving), recent developments suggest that "macroporous" gels could also
                  be produced in the domain of polyacrylamides. If constraints to chain motion are imposed during gel polymerization, large-pore
                  structures can be grown. Such constraints can originate either from low temperatures or from the presence of preformed polymers
                  in the gelling solution; in both cases, the growing chains are forced to "laterally aggregate" via inter-chain hydrogen bond
                  formation. Upon consumption of pendant double bonds, such bundles are frozen in the three-dimensional space by permanent cross-links.
                  As an additional development, a novel photopolymerization system is described, comprising a cationic dye (methylene blue)
                  and a redox couple (sodium toluene sulfinate, a reducer, and diphenyliodonium chloride, a mild oxidizer). Methylene blue catalysis
                  is characterized by a unique efficiency, ensuring&gt;96% conversion of monomers, even in hydro-organic solvents and in the presence
                  of surfactants, which normally quench or completely inhibit the persulphate-driven reaction. In addition, methylene blue-sustained
                  photopolymerization can be operated in the entire pH 3-10 interval, where most other systems fail. Perhaps the most striking
                  novelty in the field is the appearance of a novel monomer (N-acryloylaminopropanol, AAP) coupling a high hydrophilicity with
                  a unique resistance to alkaline hydrolysis. Given the fact that a poly(AAP) matrix is 500 times more stable than a poly(acrylamide)
                  gel, while being twice as hydrophilic, it is anticipated that this novel chemistry will have no difficulties in replacing
                  the old electrophoretic anticonvective media. The review ends with a glimpse at novel sieving media in capillary zone electrophoresis:
                  polymer networks. Such media, by providing an almost infinite range of pore sizes, due to the absence of a rigid support,
                  allow sieving mechanisms to be operative over a wide interval of particle sizes, even up to genomic DNA. Viscous solutions
                  of polymer networks, made with the novel poly(AAP) chemistry, allow repeated use of the same separation column, well above
                  50 injections. Silica-bound poly(AAP) chains provide effective quenching of electrosmosis and&gt;200 analyses by isoelectric
                  focusing.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Gold_nanoparticles_asl04">A fluorescence-based detection scheme that uses ligand functionalized gold nanoparticles is proposed. The transduction scheme
                  is based on the strong quenching of the fluorescence emission exerted by metallic surfaces on fluorophores positioned in their
                  immediate vicinity (&lt;5 nm). Binding of fluorophore-labeled anti-biotin to biotinylated gold nanoparticles resulted in decreasedfluorescence
                  emission intensity. Subsequent competitive dissociation of labeled anti-biotin with D-biotin resulted in increased fluorescence
                  emission intensity. These interactions occurred by means of specific molecular recognition because when the binding sites
                  of anti-biotin were saturated with D-biotin prior to interaction with the gold nanoparticles; changes in the fluorescence
                  emission intensity were not observed.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Gold_nanorods_per04">The incorporation of metal nanoparticles with various size and shapes provides silica gels with optical functionalities arising
                  from the characteristic optical properties of the starting nanoparticle dispersions. The uniform distribution of the preformed
                  nanoparticles and their mutual separation within the gels are key factors to maintain single-particle properties. These requirements
                  are achieved by coating the nanoparticles with thin silica shells, which greatly enhance their stability and ensure separation
                  between metal nanoparticle cores. The great advantage of this procedure is its ability to use nanoparticles with tailored
                  shapes and thus to expand the possible functionalities to be implemented. We show the incorporation of gold nanorods with
                  varying aspect ratio, which allows to have well-defined absorption bands even in the near infrared.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_H_D_exchange_grd02">The secondary structure of bovine serum albumin (BSA) is determined from infrared spectra (cast films, solution in phosphate
                  buffer) by analyzing the structure of Amide bands. Due to strong overlapping of intrinsic bands three classical methods of
                  band decomposition was implemented: Fourier self deconvolution, second derivatives and band fitting algorithm. The initial
                  values for the number of the components and their position was checked with a novel procedure of dry and hydrated H/D exchange.
                  The most dominant band component in Amide I region is the band at 1654 cm-1, which is usually attributed to a-helical structure.
                  Other bands in Amide I region are attributed to various type of turns. Hydration of protein, as well as the solvation of protein
                  in phosphate buffer, induces the radical change in the secondary structure, especially in the population of a-helices. Drying
                  of the protein film causes a partial denaturation. Classical methods for determine the changes in secondary structure are
                  not accurate enough. Moreover, the interpretation of changes can be easily misleading. Hence, the difference spectroscopy
                  was used to clarify the effects of hydration and solvation on the protein secondary structure. The solvated protein was measured
                  in ATR cell. For proper compare the ATR spectrum with the normal transmission one, first optical constant n and k were calculated
                  and later the exact absorption spectrum.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_HF_calculations_and04">We present a model to evaluate the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of electronic excited states of a molecule close to
                  a metal particle of complex shape and, possibly, in the presence of a solvent. The molecule is treated quantum mechanically
                  at Hartree?Fock (HF) or density-functional theory (DFT) level. The metal/solvent is considered as a continuous body, characterized
                  by its frequency dependent local dielectric constant. For simple metal shapes (planar infinite surface and spherical particle)
                  a version of the polarizable continuum model based on the integral equation formalism has been used, while an alternative
                  methodology has been implemented to treat metal particles of arbitrary shape. In both cases, equations have been numerically
                  solved using a boundary element method. Excitation energies and nonradiative decay rates due to the energy transfer from the
                  molecule to the metal are evaluated exploiting the linear response theory (TDHF or TDDFT where TD?time dependent). The radiative
                  decay rate of the whole system (molecule+metal/solvent) is calculated, still using a continuum model, in terms of the response
                  of the surrounding to the molecular transition. The model presented has been applied to the study of the radiative and nonradiative
                  lifetimes of a lissamine molecule in solution (water) and close to gold spherical nanoparticles of different radius. In addition,
                  the influence of the metal shape has been analyzed by performing calculations on a system composed by a coumarin-type molecule
                  close to silver aggregates of complex shape.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Homodyning_tsc01">A new instrument, based on the principle of phase analysis light scattering (PALS) for the measurement of electrophoretic
                  mobilities, has been produced. Such measurements are particularly useful in the study of dispersions in nonpolar and highly
                  conducting media. The current PALS configuration can be used to measure mobilities up to 3 orders of magnitude lower than
                  with the conventional Doppler mode. The device has a number of new features; in particular, all the signal processing is digital
                  and the optical system features a reference beam configuration. Data are presented to show that on suitable samples both the
                  PALS technique and conventional laser Doppler electrophoresis can be performed on the same instrument and the techniques are

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_LIDAR_mor05">Fast and numerically stable transfer-matrix solution is presented for the classical electromagnetics problem of a dipole radiating
                  inside and outside a stratified sphere consisting of concentric spherical shells. There is no limitation on the dipole position,
                  the number of the concentric shells, the shell medium, or on the sphere radius. Electromagnetic fields are determined anywhere
                  in the space, the time-averaged angular distribution of the radiated power, the total radiated power, Ohmic losses due to
                  an absorbing shell, and Green?s function are calculated. An absorbing, optically active, and ultrathin (less, approximate10
                  nm) metallic shell (core), characterized by a nonlocal dielectric function, are all allowed. The classical results are then
                  applied to inelastic light scattering (fluorescence and Raman), the radiative and nonradiative normalized decay rates, and
                  frequency shift. Using correspondence principle, the radiative decay rate is calculated from the Poynting vector, whereas
                  the nonradiative decay rate is calculated from the Ohmic losses inside a sphere absorptive shell. Numerical stability of our
                  method and limitations of classical description of decay rates are addressed. The importance of grouping various radiative
                  and nonradiative decay mechanisms into local and nonlocal decay rates is emphasized. Further possible extensions of the theory
                  presented here to the case of an arbitrary multilayered (axially symmetric) particle and to the classical problem of a radiating
                  quadrupole in the presence of a multilayered particle are briefly outlined. Various applications for chemical speciation,
                  LIDAR, fluorescent microscopy, engineering of decay rates, identification of biological particles, and monitoring specific
                  cell functions are envisaged. Computer program is freely available at http://www.wave-scattering.com.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Landau_levels_pus06">We present a microscopic model for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) from molecules adsorbed on small noble-metal nanoparticles.
                  In the absence of direct overlap of molecular orbitals and electronic states in the metal, the main enhancement source is
                  the strong electric field of the surface plasmon resonance in a nanoparticle acting on a molecule near the surface. In small
                  particles, the electromagnetic enhancement is strongly modified by quantum-size effects. We show that, in nanometer-sized
                  particles, SERS magnitude is determined by a competition between several quantum-size effects such as the Landau damping of
                  surface plasmon resonance and reduced screening near the nanoparticle surface. Using time-dependent local density approximation,
                  we calculate spatial distribution of local fields near the surface and enhancement factor for different nanoparticles sizes.

                  resonance (MDR). The bonding and antibonding modes of the MDR correspond to strong attraction and repulsion, respectively.
                  The dependence of the force on separation and the role of absorption are discussed. At resonance, the force can be enhanced
                  by orders of magnitude such that it will dominate other relevant forces. We found that a stable binding configuration can
                  be induced by the resonant optical force.

                  (SERS) effect. The image enhancement effect is calculated including the nonlocal response of the metal and finite molecular
                  size. The effect is much reduced (Ã 10^?5) from that for a point molecule above a local metal but can still give a gain ?
                  10^3. The power emitted by a dipole above a smooth surface is also calculated. For an Ag surface the power emitted in the
                  form of photons, surface plasmons, and electron-hole excitations are found to be in the ratio 1 : 3 : 10^6. The numerical
                  results are calculated using the semi-classical infinite-barrier model of the metal surface with a Lindhard dielectric function
                  modified to take into account finite electron lifetime and core polarization.

                  id="abstract_MOLECULAR_emission_cavity_analysis_har89">This articles discusses the emergence of a field of atomic physics and quantum optics called cavity quantum electrodynamics
                  (QED). In addition to demonstrating dramatic changes in spontaneous emission, cavity QED has led to the creation of new kinds
                  of microscopic masers that operate with a single atom and a few photons or with photons emitted in pairs in a two-photon transition.
                  The influence of boundary conditions on atomic radiation was pointed out long ago, and a considerable body of literature exists
                  on the subject. Until recently, however, experimental evidence for these effects had been scarce because of the difficulties
                  of preparing, controlling and observing the emission of isolated atoms or molecules near surfaces. Just as a cavity below
                  cutoff suppresses vacuum fluctuations, a resonance cavity enhances them. In addition to changing the radiation rate of atoms,
                  atom-cavity coupling also includes energy shifts. This phenomenon can be understood as a frequency-pulling effect t

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Metal_optics_mor02">Highly accurate computations of surface plasmons in metallic nanostructures with various geometries are presented. Calculations
                  for cylinders with irregular cross section, coupled structures, and periodic gratings are shown. These systems exhibit a resonant
                  behavior with complex field distribution and strong field enhancement, and therefore their computation requires a very accurate
                  numerical method. It is shown that the multiple multipole (MMP) method, together with an automatic multipole setting (AMS)
                  procedure, is well suited for these computations. An AMS technique for the two-dimensional MMP method is presented. It relies
                  on the global topology of each domain boundary to generate a distribution of numerically independent multipole expansions.
                  This technique greatly facilitates the MMP modeling.

                  id="abstract_Metal_enhanced_fluorescence_ged03a">Substantial increases in fluorescence emission from fluorophore-protein-coated fractal-like silver structures have been observed.
                  We review two methods for silver fractal structure preparation, which have been employed and studied. The first, a roughened
                  silver electrode, typically yielded a 100-fold increase in fluorophore emission, and the second, silver fractal-like structures
                  grown on glass between two silver electrodes, produced a [ap]500-fold increase. In addition, significant increases in probe
                  photostability were observed for probes coated on the silver fractal like structures. These results further serve to compliment
                  our recent work on the effects of nobel metal particles with fluorophores, a relatively new phenomenon in fluorescence we
                  have termed both 'metal-enhanced fluorescence' [1] and 'radiative decay engineering' [2,3]. These results are explained by
                  the metallic surfaces modifying the radiative decay rate ([Gamma]) of the fluorescent labels. We believe that this new silver-surface
                  preparation, which results in ultrabright and photostable fluorophores, offers a new generic technology platform for increased
                  fluorescence signal levels, with widespread potential applications to the analytical sciences, imaging, and medical diagnostics.

                  id="abstract_N_Acryloylaminoethoxyethanol_rig97">Some unique events have occurred in the last few years which might revolutionize the field of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
                  While it was widely recognized that such matrices could normally be cast with a small pore size distribution, typically of
                  the order of a few nanometers diameter (for protein sieving), recent developments suggest that "macroporous" gels could also
                  be produced in the domain of polyacrylamides. If constraints to chain motion are imposed during gel polymerization, large-pore
                  structures can be grown. Such constraints can originate either from low temperatures or from the presence of preformed polymers
                  in the gelling solution; in both cases, the growing chains are forced to "laterally aggregate" via inter-chain hydrogen bond
                  formation. Upon consumption of pendant double bonds, such bundles are frozen in the three-dimensional space by permanent cross-links.
                  As an additional development, a novel photopolymerization system is described, comprising a cationic dye (methylene blue)
                  and a redox couple (sodium toluene sulfinate, a reducer, and diphenyliodonium chloride, a mild oxidizer). Methylene blue catalysis
                  is characterized by a unique efficiency, ensuring&gt;96% conversion of monomers, even in hydro-organic solvents and in the presence
                  of surfactants, which normally quench or completely inhibit the persulphate-driven reaction. In addition, methylene blue-sustained
                  photopolymerization can be operated in the entire pH 3-10 interval, where most other systems fail. Perhaps the most striking
                  novelty in the field is the appearance of a novel monomer (N-acryloylaminopropanol, AAP) coupling a high hydrophilicity with
                  a unique resistance to alkaline hydrolysis. Given the fact that a poly(AAP) matrix is 500 times more stable than a poly(acrylamide)
                  gel, while being twice as hydrophilic, it is anticipated that this novel chemistry will have no difficulties in replacing
                  the old electrophoretic anticonvective media. The review ends with a glimpse at novel sieving media in capillary zone electrophoresis:
                  polymer networks. Such media, by providing an almost infinite range of pore sizes, due to the absence of a rigid support,
                  allow sieving mechanisms to be operative over a wide interval of particle sizes, even up to genomic DNA. Viscous solutions
                  of polymer networks, made with the novel poly(AAP) chemistry, allow repeated use of the same separation column, well above
                  50 injections. Silica-bound poly(AAP) chains provide effective quenching of electrosmosis and&gt;200 analyses by isoelectric
                  focusing.

                  from the characteristic optical properties of the starting nanoparticle dispersions. The uniform distribution of the preformed
                  nanoparticles and their mutual separation within the gels are key factors to maintain single-particle properties. These requirements
                  are achieved by coating the nanoparticles with thin silica shells, which greatly enhance their stability and ensure separation
                  between metal nanoparticle cores. The great advantage of this procedure is its ability to use nanoparticles with tailored
                  shapes and thus to expand the possible functionalities to be implemented. We show the incorporation of gold nanorods with
                  varying aspect ratio, which allows to have well-defined absorption bands even in the near infrared.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Nanogold_hai00">Recent advances in gold technology have led to probes with improved properties and performance for cell biologists: higher
                  labeling density, better sensitivity, and greater penetration into tissues. Gold clusters, such as the 1.4-nm Nanogold, are
                  gold compounds that can be covalently linked to Fab' antibody fragments, making small and stable probes. Silver enhancement
                  then makes these small gold particles easily visible by EM, LM, and directly by eye. Another advance is the combination of
                  fluorescent and gold probes for correlative microscopy. Chemical crosslinking of gold particles to many biologically active
                  molecules has made possible many novel probes, such as gold?lipids, gold?Ni?NTA, and gold?ATP.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Nanoparticle_car06">We study the spontaneous emission of a single emitter close to a metallic nanoparticle, with the aim to clarify the distance
                  dependence of the radiative and non-radiative decay rates. We derive analytical formulas based on a dipole-dipole model, and
                  show that the non-radiative decay rate follows a R-6 dependence at short distance, where R is the distance between the emitter
                  and the center of the nanoparticle, as in Forster's energy transfer. The distance dependence of the radiative decay rate is
                  more subtle. It is chiefly dominated by a R-3 dependence, a R-6 dependence being visible at plasmon resonance. The latter
                  is a consequence of radiative damping in the effective dipole polarizability of the nanoparticle. The different distance behavior
                  of the radiative and non-radiative decay rates implies that the apparent quantum yield always vanishes at short distance.
                  Moreover, non-radiative decay is strongly enhanced when the emitter radiates at the plasmon-resonance frequency of the nanoparticle.

                  for cylinders with irregular cross section, coupled structures, and periodic gratings are shown. These systems exhibit a resonant
                  behavior with complex field distribution and strong field enhancement, and therefore their computation requires a very accurate
                  numerical method. It is shown that the multiple multipole (MMP) method, together with an automatic multipole setting (AMS)
                  procedure, is well suited for these computations. An AMS technique for the two-dimensional MMP method is presented. It relies
                  on the global topology of each domain boundary to generate a distribution of numerically independent multipole expansions.
                  This technique greatly facilitates the MMP modeling.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_OPTICAL_properties_gen03">In this report we show the possibility of broadband low-pass filters with windows of transparency in pre-set spectral ranges.
                  Those filters are based on the unique optical properties of metal-dielectric composites near the percolation threshold. In
                  such composites, metal clusters of different sizes and shapes have different plasmon resonances and resonate nearly independently
                  at different wavelengths. All together, the resonant plasmon modes cover a very broad spectral range. Applying the effect
                  of spectrally selective photo-modification, we develop a procedure that creates mid-infrared windows of transparency within
                  the broadband filters. We also investigate the possibilities of making low-pass filters composed of spheroids and conductive
                  sticks with certain distributions of aspect ratios.

                  decay rate as well as the shift of resonance frequency in the response of the metal surface. As a result, the optical force
                  is determined not only by the gradient of field but also the polarizability depending on the position and orientation of the
                  molecule. In addition, we find the resulting reactive force cannot be expressed as a gradient of a scalar potential, in contrast
                  to the usual situations.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Optical_properties_per04">The incorporation of metal nanoparticles with various size and shapes provides silica gels with optical functionalities arising
                  from the characteristic optical properties of the starting nanoparticle dispersions. The uniform distribution of the preformed
                  nanoparticles and their mutual separation within the gels are key factors to maintain single-particle properties. These requirements
                  are achieved by coating the nanoparticles with thin silica shells, which greatly enhance their stability and ensure separation
                  between metal nanoparticle cores. The great advantage of this procedure is its ability to use nanoparticles with tailored
                  shapes and thus to expand the possible functionalities to be implemented. We show the incorporation of gold nanorods with
                  varying aspect ratio, which allows to have well-defined absorption bands even in the near infrared.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_PHYSICAL_sciences_gen03">In this report we show the possibility of broadband low-pass filters with windows of transparency in pre-set spectral ranges.
                  Those filters are based on the unique optical properties of metal-dielectric composites near the percolation threshold. In
                  such composites, metal clusters of different sizes and shapes have different plasmon resonances and resonate nearly independently
                  at different wavelengths. All together, the resonant plasmon modes cover a very broad spectral range. Applying the effect
                  of spectrally selective photo-modification, we develop a procedure that creates mid-infrared windows of transparency within
                  the broadband filters. We also investigate the possibilities of making low-pass filters composed of spheroids and conductive
                  sticks with certain distributions of aspect ratios.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_PHYSICS_har89">This articles discusses the emergence of a field of atomic physics and quantum optics called cavity quantum electrodynamics
                  (QED). In addition to demonstrating dramatic changes in spontaneous emission, cavity QED has led to the creation of new kinds
                  of microscopic masers that operate with a single atom and a few photons or with photons emitted in pairs in a two-photon transition.
                  The influence of boundary conditions on atomic radiation was pointed out long ago, and a considerable body of literature exists
                  on the subject. Until recently, however, experimental evidence for these effects had been scarce because of the difficulties
                  of preparing, controlling and observing the emission of isolated atoms or molecules near surfaces. Just as a cavity below
                  cutoff suppresses vacuum fluctuations, a resonance cavity enhances them. In addition to changing the radiation rate of atoms,
                  atom-cavity coupling also includes energy shifts. This phenomenon can be understood as a frequency-pulling effect t

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Particles_rom06">The response of gold nanoparticle dimers is studied theoretically near and beyond the limit where the particles are touching.
                  As the particles approach each other, a dominant dipole feature is observed that is pushed into the infrared due to interparticle
                  coupling and that is associated with a large pileup of induced charge in the interparticle gap. The redshift becomes singular
                  as the particle separation decreases. The response weakens for very small separation when the coupling across the interparticle
                  gap becomes so strong that dipolar oscillations across the pair are inhibited. Lowerwavelength, higher-order modes show a
                  similar separation dependence in nearly touching dimers. After touching, singular behavior is observed through the emergence
                  of a new infrared absorption peak, also accompanied by huge charge pileup at the interparticle junction, if initial interparticle-contact
                  is made at a single point. This new mode is distinctly different from the lowest mode of the separated dimer. When the junction
                  is made by contact between flat surfaces, charge at the junction is neutralized and mode evolution is continuous through contact.
                  The calculated singular response explains recent experiments on metallic nanoparticle dimers and is relevant in the design
                  of nanoparticle-based sensors and plasmon circuits.

                  and photophysical properties have been compared to those of the corresponding two-dimensional system of self-assembled monolayers
                  (SAMs) of the porphyrin as well as the bis(porphyrin) disulfide reference in solutions. In particular, the time-resolved single-photon
                  counting fluorescence studies have indicated that the undesirable quenching of the porphyrin excited singlet state via energy
                  transfer to the gold surface of the three-dimensional system is much suppressed, as compared to the quenching of the porphyrin

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Photomodification_gen03">In this report we show the possibility of broadband low-pass filters with windows of transparency in pre-set spectral ranges.
                  Those filters are based on the unique optical properties of metal-dielectric composites near the percolation threshold. In
                  such composites, metal clusters of different sizes and shapes have different plasmon resonances and resonate nearly independently
                  at different wavelengths. All together, the resonant plasmon modes cover a very broad spectral range. Applying the effect
                  of spectrally selective photo-modification, we develop a procedure that creates mid-infrared windows of transparency within
                  the broadband filters. We also investigate the possibilities of making low-pass filters composed of spheroids and conductive
                  sticks with certain distributions of aspect ratios.

                  id="abstract_Physical_optics___Electromagnetic_theory_cha06">We study the local-field enhancement in a nanocavity created by optical nanomanipulation. Recently we showed that a metallic
                  probe can modify the optical force experienced by a metallic particle and generate a material selective trapping potential.
                  We show that the same configuration used for optical forces can be used to control both in magnitude and tune the local-field
                  enhancement around the particle at resonance. The spatial resolution and material selectivity of this technique, allied to
                  its capability to manipulate particles at the nanometric level, may offer a new and versatile way to achieve surface-enhanced
                  Raman scattering spectroscopy at the single-molecule level.

                  and photophysical properties have been compared to those of the corresponding two-dimensional system of self-assembled monolayers
                  (SAMs) of the porphyrin as well as the bis(porphyrin) disulfide reference in solutions. In particular, the time-resolved single-photon
                  counting fluorescence studies have indicated that the undesirable quenching of the porphyrin excited singlet state via energy
                  transfer to the gold surface of the three-dimensional system is much suppressed, as compared to the quenching of the porphyrin
                  SAMs on the two-dimensional flat gold surface. Thus, the present systems have a variety of potential utility for development

                  possible to increase the radiative decay rate by three orders of magnitude while keeping a quantum efficiency larger than
                  80% in the near-infrared regime. We examine the competition between the radiative and nonradiative processes in the presence
                  of the antennae as a function of wavelength and antenna geometry. Our results hold great promise for improving the quantum
                  efficiency of poor emitters such as silicon nanocrystals or carbon nanotubes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Quenching_car06">We study the spontaneous emission of a single emitter close to a metallic nanoparticle, with the aim to clarify the distance
                  dependence of the radiative and non-radiative decay rates. We derive analytical formulas based on a dipole-dipole model, and
                  show that the non-radiative decay rate follows a R-6 dependence at short distance, where R is the distance between the emitter
                  and the center of the nanoparticle, as in Forster's energy transfer. The distance dependence of the radiative decay rate is
                  more subtle. It is chiefly dominated by a R-3 dependence, a R-6 dependence being visible at plasmon resonance. The latter
                  is a consequence of radiative damping in the effective dipole polarizability of the nanoparticle. The different distance behavior
                  of the radiative and non-radiative decay rates implies that the apparent quantum yield always vanishes at short distance.
                  Moreover, non-radiative decay is strongly enhanced when the emitter radiates at the plasmon-resonance frequency of the nanoparticle.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_RSA_grd02">The secondary structure of bovine serum albumin (BSA) is determined from infrared spectra (cast films, solution in phosphate
                  buffer) by analyzing the structure of Amide bands. Due to strong overlapping of intrinsic bands three classical methods of
                  band decomposition was implemented: Fourier self deconvolution, second derivatives and band fitting algorithm. The initial
                  values for the number of the components and their position was checked with a novel procedure of dry and hydrated H/D exchange.
                  The most dominant band component in Amide I region is the band at 1654 cm-1, which is usually attributed to a-helical structure.
                  Other bands in Amide I region are attributed to various type of turns. Hydration of protein, as well as the solvation of protein
                  in phosphate buffer, induces the radical change in the secondary structure, especially in the population of a-helices. Drying
                  of the protein film causes a partial denaturation. Classical methods for determine the changes in secondary structure are
                  not accurate enough. Moreover, the interpretation of changes can be easily misleading. Hence, the difference spectroscopy
                  was used to clarify the effects of hydration and solvation on the protein secondary structure. The solvated protein was measured
                  in ATR cell. For proper compare the ATR spectrum with the normal transmission one, first optical constant n and k were calculated
                  and later the exact absorption spectrum.

                  inside and outside a stratified sphere consisting of concentric spherical shells. There is no limitation on the dipole position,
                  the number of the concentric shells, the shell medium, or on the sphere radius. Electromagnetic fields are determined anywhere
                  in the space, the time-averaged angular distribution of the radiated power, the total radiated power, Ohmic losses due to
                  an absorbing shell, and Green?s function are calculated. An absorbing, optically active, and ultrathin (less, approximate10
                  nm) metallic shell (core), characterized by a nonlocal dielectric function, are all allowed. The classical results are then
                  applied to inelastic light scattering (fluorescence and Raman), the radiative and nonradiative normalized decay rates, and
                  frequency shift. Using correspondence principle, the radiative decay rate is calculated from the Poynting vector, whereas
                  the nonradiative decay rate is calculated from the Ohmic losses inside a sphere absorptive shell. Numerical stability of our
                  method and limitations of classical description of decay rates are addressed. The importance of grouping various radiative
                  and nonradiative decay mechanisms into local and nonlocal decay rates is emphasized. Further possible extensions of the theory
                  presented here to the case of an arbitrary multilayered (axially symmetric) particle and to the classical problem of a radiating
                  quadrupole in the presence of a multilayered particle are briefly outlined. Various applications for chemical speciation,
                  LIDAR, fluorescent microscopy, engineering of decay rates, identification of biological particles, and monitoring specific
                  cell functions are envisaged. Computer program is freely available at http://www.wave-scattering.com.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Raman_grd02">The secondary structure of bovine serum albumin (BSA) is determined from infrared spectra (cast films, solution in phosphate
                  buffer) by analyzing the structure of Amide bands. Due to strong overlapping of intrinsic bands three classical methods of
                  band decomposition was implemented: Fourier self deconvolution, second derivatives and band fitting algorithm. The initial
                  values for the number of the components and their position was checked with a novel procedure of dry and hydrated H/D exchange.
                  The most dominant band component in Amide I region is the band at 1654 cm-1, which is usually attributed to a-helical structure.
                  Other bands in Amide I region are attributed to various type of turns. Hydration of protein, as well as the solvation of protein
                  in phosphate buffer, induces the radical change in the secondary structure, especially in the population of a-helices. Drying
                  of the protein film causes a partial denaturation. Classical methods for determine the changes in secondary structure are
                  not accurate enough. Moreover, the interpretation of changes can be easily misleading. Hence, the difference spectroscopy
                  was used to clarify the effects of hydration and solvation on the protein secondary structure. The solvated protein was measured
                  in ATR cell. For proper compare the ATR spectrum with the normal transmission one, first optical constant n and k were calculated
                  and later the exact absorption spectrum.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Raman_scattering_mor05">Fast and numerically stable transfer-matrix solution is presented for the classical electromagnetics problem of a dipole radiating
                  inside and outside a stratified sphere consisting of concentric spherical shells. There is no limitation on the dipole position,
                  the number of the concentric shells, the shell medium, or on the sphere radius. Electromagnetic fields are determined anywhere
                  in the space, the time-averaged angular distribution of the radiated power, the total radiated power, Ohmic losses due to
                  an absorbing shell, and Green?s function are calculated. An absorbing, optically active, and ultrathin (less, approximate10
                  nm) metallic shell (core), characterized by a nonlocal dielectric function, are all allowed. The classical results are then
                  applied to inelastic light scattering (fluorescence and Raman), the radiative and nonradiative normalized decay rates, and
                  frequency shift. Using correspondence principle, the radiative decay rate is calculated from the Poynting vector, whereas
                  the nonradiative decay rate is calculated from the Ohmic losses inside a sphere absorptive shell. Numerical stability of our
                  method and limitations of classical description of decay rates are addressed. The importance of grouping various radiative
                  and nonradiative decay mechanisms into local and nonlocal decay rates is emphasized. Further possible extensions of the theory
                  presented here to the case of an arbitrary multilayered (axially symmetric) particle and to the classical problem of a radiating
                  quadrupole in the presence of a multilayered particle are briefly outlined. Various applications for chemical speciation,
                  LIDAR, fluorescent microscopy, engineering of decay rates, identification of biological particles, and monitoring specific
                  cell functions are envisaged. Computer program is freely available at http://www.wave-scattering.com.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Reviews_rig97">Some unique events have occurred in the last few years which might revolutionize the field of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
                  While it was widely recognized that such matrices could normally be cast with a small pore size distribution, typically of
                  the order of a few nanometers diameter (for protein sieving), recent developments suggest that "macroporous" gels could also
                  be produced in the domain of polyacrylamides. If constraints to chain motion are imposed during gel polymerization, large-pore
                  structures can be grown. Such constraints can originate either from low temperatures or from the presence of preformed polymers
                  in the gelling solution; in both cases, the growing chains are forced to "laterally aggregate" via inter-chain hydrogen bond
                  formation. Upon consumption of pendant double bonds, such bundles are frozen in the three-dimensional space by permanent cross-links.
                  As an additional development, a novel photopolymerization system is described, comprising a cationic dye (methylene blue)
                  and a redox couple (sodium toluene sulfinate, a reducer, and diphenyliodonium chloride, a mild oxidizer). Methylene blue catalysis
                  is characterized by a unique efficiency, ensuring&gt;96% conversion of monomers, even in hydro-organic solvents and in the presence
                  of surfactants, which normally quench or completely inhibit the persulphate-driven reaction. In addition, methylene blue-sustained
                  photopolymerization can be operated in the entire pH 3-10 interval, where most other systems fail. Perhaps the most striking
                  novelty in the field is the appearance of a novel monomer (N-acryloylaminopropanol, AAP) coupling a high hydrophilicity with
                  a unique resistance to alkaline hydrolysis. Given the fact that a poly(AAP) matrix is 500 times more stable than a poly(acrylamide)
                  gel, while being twice as hydrophilic, it is anticipated that this novel chemistry will have no difficulties in replacing
                  the old electrophoretic anticonvective media. The review ends with a glimpse at novel sieving media in capillary zone electrophoresis:
                  polymer networks. Such media, by providing an almost infinite range of pore sizes, due to the absence of a rigid support,
                  allow sieving mechanisms to be operative over a wide interval of particle sizes, even up to genomic DNA. Viscous solutions
                  of polymer networks, made with the novel poly(AAP) chemistry, allow repeated use of the same separation column, well above
                  50 injections. Silica-bound poly(AAP) chains provide effective quenching of electrosmosis and&gt;200 analyses by isoelectric
                  focusing.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Rhodamine__G__Rh_G__wid97">The feasibility of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) for the monitoring of fast kinetic processes has been investigated.
                  The interaction between Rh6G and different nucleotides in water served as a model system. Following the fluorescence fluctuations
                  arising due to dye-nucleotide interactions around an unperturbed equilibrium it is possible to retrieve information about
                  association and dissociation kinetics of the different electronic states involved in the fluorescence generation. No macroscopic
                  perturbation of thermodynamic parameters, as in chemical relaxation experiments, is needed. Compared to other fluorescence
                  techniques used to study interactions of this kind, such as flash photolysis, FCS requires a very simple instrumentation.
                  A very broad time interval can be covered and the fact that FCS is based on a fluorescence microscope allows for kinetic studies
                  on a microscopic scale. Hence, FCS can be used in parallel or as an alternative to more established fluorescence techniques
                  providing a simple and easy-to-use tool by which similar and complementary information on kinetic processes can be obtained.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_SERS_mos05">The electromagnetic theory of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), despite its simplicity, can account for all major
                  SERS observations, including: the need for a nanostructured material as the SERS-active system; the observation that some
                  metals form good SERS-active systems while others do not; the observation that strongly interacting metal nanoparticles result
                  in very much more effective SERS-active systems; the observed polarization sensitivity shown by nanoparticle aggregates; and
                  the optical behavior of nanostructured metals in the absence of a molecular adsorbate. By extending the ideas inherent in
                  the electromagnetic model one can also understand the seminal features reported for single-molecule SERS, including the puzzling
                  observation that only a few silver particles in an ensemble are hot (they are appropriately structured nanoparticle clusters)
                  and that for a hot particle, once one is able to observe SERS, adding more adsorbate does not significantly alter the intensity
                  (once the electromagnetic hot spot is occupied, adding adsorbate to other sites on the nanoparticle cluster will not add greatly
                  to the observed intensity). However, the electromagnetic model does not account for all that is learned through SERS. Molecular
                  resonances, charge-transfer transitions and other processes such as ballistic electrons transiently probing the region where
                  the molecule resides and then modulating electronic processes of the metal as a result certainly contribute to the rich information
                  SERS reports; and by virtue of the fact that these contributions will vary from molecule to molecule, they will constitute
                  the most interesting aspects reported by SERS. But, the overall reason why SERS produces such inordinate enhancements is largely
                  an electromagnetic property of nanostructures.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_SERS_suh03">We have studied the laser-excitation-intensity-dependent and Ag-nanocluster interstitial-site-dependent SERS intensity fluctuations
                  under low molecule surface coverage of rhodamine 6G and cytochrome c. A new two-channel photon time-stamping system coupled
                  with atomic force microscopic (AFM), Raman spectroscopic, and imaging microscopy was developed and applied to record Raman
                  intensity fluctuation trajectories at sub-microsecond resolution correlated with in situ characterization of the nanoparticle
                  clusters. Our experimental results suggest that the nanoconfinement of the local electromagnetic-field enhancement and the
                  interaction of the local field with the molecules, presumably under rotational motions, result in nano-Raman fluctuations.
                  The SERS spectral fluctuation was pertinent to the nanoscale local enhancement and local interaction of the molecules with
                  the surface when the surface coverage of the nanoparticles was less than a monolayer, and the nanoscale interstitial space
                  controlled the finite number of molecules to contribute the microscopic Raman signal collected from a diffraction-limited
                  focus spot. The fluctuation amplitude significantly decreased with the number of molecules confined at the nanolocal field.
                  The nano-SERS fluctuation dynamics were both photo-induced and spontaneous for rhodamine 6G, but only the photo-induced component
                  was observable for cytochrome c. The fluctuation dynamics were also found to be highly inhomogeneous at interstitial sites
                  with heterogeneous geometries. To interpret the observed nano-SERS fluctuation dynamics, we used computer simulation of optical
                  multiple scattering, based on multi-sphere scattering Mie theory, and rotational diffusion of molecules at an interstitial
                  site, based on a random walk in orientation space.

                  id="abstract_SURFACE_plasmon_resonance_gen03">In this report we show the possibility of broadband low-pass filters with windows of transparency in pre-set spectral ranges.
                  Those filters are based on the unique optical properties of metal-dielectric composites near the percolation threshold. In
                  such composites, metal clusters of different sizes and shapes have different plasmon resonances and resonate nearly independently
                  at different wavelengths. All together, the resonant plasmon modes cover a very broad spectral range. Applying the effect
                  of spectrally selective photo-modification, we develop a procedure that creates mid-infrared windows of transparency within
                  the broadband filters. We also investigate the possibilities of making low-pass filters composed of spheroids and conductive
                  sticks with certain distributions of aspect ratios.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Scattering_mor02">Highly accurate computations of surface plasmons in metallic nanostructures with various geometries are presented. Calculations
                  for cylinders with irregular cross section, coupled structures, and periodic gratings are shown. These systems exhibit a resonant
                  behavior with complex field distribution and strong field enhancement, and therefore their computation requires a very accurate
                  numerical method. It is shown that the multiple multipole (MMP) method, together with an automatic multipole setting (AMS)
                  procedure, is well suited for these computations. An AMS technique for the two-dimensional MMP method is presented. It relies
                  on the global topology of each domain boundary to generate a distribution of numerically independent multipole expansions.
                  This technique greatly facilitates the MMP modeling.

                  from the characteristic optical properties of the starting nanoparticle dispersions. The uniform distribution of the preformed
                  nanoparticles and their mutual separation within the gels are key factors to maintain single-particle properties. These requirements
                  are achieved by coating the nanoparticles with thin silica shells, which greatly enhance their stability and ensure separation
                  between metal nanoparticle cores. The great advantage of this procedure is its ability to use nanoparticles with tailored
                  shapes and thus to expand the possible functionalities to be implemented. We show the incorporation of gold nanorods with
                  varying aspect ratio, which allows to have well-defined absorption bands even in the near infrared.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Silver_island_films_luk04">We observed a strong, more than 16-fold, enhancement of Texas Red-labeled BSA fluorescence emission when deposited on silver
                  colloid coated surfaces (SCCS). The same labeled protein deposited on silver island films (SIFs) showed an approximate 8-fold
                  fluorescence enhancement. The lifetimes of Texas Red-BSA fluorescence are significantly shorter on silvered surfaces than
                  on uncoated quartz substrate indicating a strong change in radiative decay rate of the dyes. We also observed a 36-fold increased
                  brightness of overlabeled fluorescein-HSA deposited on silver colloid coated surface. Stronger enhancement observed for overlabeled
                  Fl-HSA protein indicates that presence of silver particles partially decreased self-quenching. Our results indicate that surfaces

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Single_molecule_car06">We study the spontaneous emission of a single emitter close to a metallic nanoparticle, with the aim to clarify the distance
                  dependence of the radiative and non-radiative decay rates. We derive analytical formulas based on a dipole-dipole model, and
                  show that the non-radiative decay rate follows a R-6 dependence at short distance, where R is the distance between the emitter
                  and the center of the nanoparticle, as in Forster's energy transfer. The distance dependence of the radiative decay rate is
                  more subtle. It is chiefly dominated by a R-3 dependence, a R-6 dependence being visible at plasmon resonance. The latter
                  is a consequence of radiative damping in the effective dipole polarizability of the nanoparticle. The different distance behavior
                  of the radiative and non-radiative decay rates implies that the apparent quantum yield always vanishes at short distance.
                  Moreover, non-radiative decay is strongly enhanced when the emitter radiates at the plasmon-resonance frequency of the nanoparticle.

                  in aqueous solution from ensemble measurements and at the single molecule level. The donor dyes: tetramethylrhodamine (TMR);
                  rhodamine 6G (R6G); and a carbocyanine dye (Cy3) were covalently attached to the 5?-end of a 40-mer model oligonucleotide.
                  The acceptor dyes, a carbocyanine dye (Cy5), and a rhodamine derivative (JA133) were attached at modified thymidine bases
                  in the complementary DNA strand with donor-acceptor distances of 5, 15, 25 and 35 DNA-bases, respectively. Anisotropy measurements
                  demonstrate that none of the dyes can be observed as a free rotor; especially in the 5-bp constructs the dyes exhibit relatively
                  high anisotropy values. Nevertheless, the dyes change their conformation with respect to the oligonucleotide on a slower time
                  scale in the millisecond range. This results in a dynamic inhomogeneous distribution of donor/acceptor (D/A) distances and
                  orientations. FRET efficiencies have been calculated from donor and acceptor fluorescence intensity as well as from time-resolved
                  fluorescence measurements of the donor fluorescence decay. Dependent on the D/A pair and distance, additional strong fluorescence
                  quenching of the donor is observed, which simulates lower FRET efficiencies at short distances and higher efficiencies at
                  longer distances. On the other hand, spFRET measurements revealed subpopulations that exhibit the expected FRET efficiency,
                  even at short D/A distances. In addition, the measured acceptor fluorescence intensities and lifetimes also partly show fluorescence
                  quenching effects independent of the excitation wavelength, i.e. either directly excited or via FRET. These effects strongly
                  depend on the D/A distance and the dyes used, respectively. The obtained data demonstrate that besides dimerization at short
                  D/A distances, an electron transfer process between the acceptor Cy5 and rhodamine donors has to be taken into account. To
                  explain deviations from FRET theory even at larger D/A distances, we suggest that the -stack of the DNA double helix mediates
                  electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor, even over distances as long as 35 base pairs. Our data show that FRET experiments
                  at the single molecule level are rather suited to resolve fluorescent subpopulations in heterogeneous mixture, information
                  about strongly quenched subpopulations gets lost.

                  id="abstract_Single_molecule_spectroscopy_suh03">We have studied the laser-excitation-intensity-dependent and Ag-nanocluster interstitial-site-dependent SERS intensity fluctuations
                  under low molecule surface coverage of rhodamine 6G and cytochrome c. A new two-channel photon time-stamping system coupled
                  with atomic force microscopic (AFM), Raman spectroscopic, and imaging microscopy was developed and applied to record Raman
                  intensity fluctuation trajectories at sub-microsecond resolution correlated with in situ characterization of the nanoparticle
                  clusters. Our experimental results suggest that the nanoconfinement of the local electromagnetic-field enhancement and the
                  interaction of the local field with the molecules, presumably under rotational motions, result in nano-Raman fluctuations.
                  The SERS spectral fluctuation was pertinent to the nanoscale local enhancement and local interaction of the molecules with
                  the surface when the surface coverage of the nanoparticles was less than a monolayer, and the nanoscale interstitial space
                  controlled the finite number of molecules to contribute the microscopic Raman signal collected from a diffraction-limited
                  focus spot. The fluctuation amplitude significantly decreased with the number of molecules confined at the nanolocal field.
                  The nano-SERS fluctuation dynamics were both photo-induced and spontaneous for rhodamine 6G, but only the photo-induced component
                  was observable for cytochrome c. The fluctuation dynamics were also found to be highly inhomogeneous at interstitial sites
                  with heterogeneous geometries. To interpret the observed nano-SERS fluctuation dynamics, we used computer simulation of optical
                  multiple scattering, based on multi-sphere scattering Mie theory, and rotational diffusion of molecules at an interstitial
                  site, based on a random walk in orientation space.

                  under low molecule surface coverage of rhodamine 6G and cytochrome c. A new two-channel photon time-stamping system coupled
                  with atomic force microscopic (AFM), Raman spectroscopic, and imaging microscopy was developed and applied to record Raman
                  intensity fluctuation trajectories at sub-microsecond resolution correlated with in situ characterization of the nanoparticle

                  interaction of the local field with the molecules, presumably under rotational motions, result in nano-Raman fluctuations.
                  The SERS spectral fluctuation was pertinent to the nanoscale local enhancement and local interaction of the molecules with
                  the surface when the surface coverage of the nanoparticles was less than a monolayer, and the nanoscale interstitial space
                  controlled the finite number of molecules to contribute the microscopic Raman signal collected from a diffraction-limited
                  focus spot. The fluctuation amplitude significantly decreased with the number of molecules confined at the nanolocal field.
                  The nano-SERS fluctuation dynamics were both photo-induced and spontaneous for rhodamine 6G, but only the photo-induced component
                  was observable for cytochrome c. The fluctuation dynamics were also found to be highly inhomogeneous at interstitial sites
                  with heterogeneous geometries. To interpret the observed nano-SERS fluctuation dynamics, we used computer simulation of optical
                  multiple scattering, based on multi-sphere scattering Mie theory, and rotational diffusion of molecules at an interstitial

                  probe can modify the optical force experienced by a metallic particle and generate a material selective trapping potential.
                  We show that the same configuration used for optical forces can be used to control both in magnitude and tune the local-field
                  enhancement around the particle at resonance. The spatial resolution and material selectivity of this technique, allied to
                  its capability to manipulate particles at the nanometric level, may offer a new and versatile way to achieve surface-enhanced
                  Raman scattering spectroscopy at the single-molecule level.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Streptomyces_avidinii_bay86">A new method for the preparation of a more efficient, stable iminobiotin-containing resin for the isolation of streptavidin
                  was developed. CL-Sepharose was activated with p-nitrophenyl chloroformate, and the resultant carbonate derivative was reacted
                  with diaminohexane. Subsequent reaction of the amino-containing resin with iminobiotin-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (in an organic
                  solvent) yielded the stable affinity resin. The capacity of this resin for either avidin of streptavidin was 12 mg per ml
                  resin, and streptavidin could be purified in one step directly from the culture broth of Streptomyces avidinii. The biotin-binding
                  protein isolated in this manner exhibited a major band at about 75 kDa and a minor band at about 150 kDa. Under denaturing
                  conditions, a spectrum of subunit molecular weights ranging between 15 and 19 kDa was detected, the distributiob of which
                  depended upon the specific preparation.

                  is determined not only by the gradient of field but also the polarizability depending on the position and orientation of the
                  molecule. In addition, we find the resulting reactive force cannot be expressed as a gradient of a scalar potential, in contrast

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Surface_plasmons_hae07">Near-field coupling of a single gold nanoparticle (GNP) to a single fluorescent molecule is investigated here for varying
                  separation d between the two. While the emission quantum efficiency of the coupled system generally decreases for d!0, a pronounced
                  near-field enhancement is observed under certain conditions, partly outweighing the efficiency loss at small distances. We
                  report on optimizing these conditions by varying the excitation field direction and the three-dimensional relative configuration
                  between the GNP and the fluorophore. Furthermore, we examine how the sphere diameter, the surrounding medium, as well as the
                  absorption and emission wavelengths of the molecular dipole influence the fluorescence yield. Our results are of high practical
                  relevance for all GNP-mediated application fields such as fluorescence microscopy, scattering near-field optical microscopy,
                  bioanalytics, and medical applications.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_Surface_plasmons_rom06">The response of gold nanoparticle dimers is studied theoretically near and beyond the limit where the particles are touching.
                  As the particles approach each other, a dominant dipole feature is observed that is pushed into the infrared due to interparticle
                  coupling and that is associated with a large pileup of induced charge in the interparticle gap. The redshift becomes singular
                  as the particle separation decreases. The response weakens for very small separation when the coupling across the interparticle
                  gap becomes so strong that dipolar oscillations across the pair are inhibited. Lowerwavelength, higher-order modes show a
                  similar separation dependence in nearly touching dimers. After touching, singular behavior is observed through the emergence
                  of a new infrared absorption peak, also accompanied by huge charge pileup at the interparticle junction, if initial interparticle-contact
                  is made at a single point. This new mode is distinctly different from the lowest mode of the separated dimer. When the junction
                  is made by contact between flat surfaces, charge at the junction is neutralized and mode evolution is continuous through contact.
                  The calculated singular response explains recent experiments on metallic nanoparticle dimers and is relevant in the design
                  of nanoparticle-based sensors and plasmon circuits.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_X_ray_structure_fre98">Previous thermodynamic and computational studies have pointed to the important energetic role of aromatic contacts in generating
                  the exceptional binding free energy of streptavidin-biotin association. We report here the crystallographic characterization
                  of single site tryptophan mutants in investigating structural consequences of alterations in these aromatic contacts. Four
                  tryptophan residues, Trp79, Trp92, Trp108 and Trp120, play an important role in the hydrophobic binding contributions, which
                  along with a hydrogen bonding network and a flexible binding loop give rise to tight ligand binding (KaÂ 1013M-1). The crystal
                  structures of ligand-free and biotin-bound mutants, W79F, W108F, W120F and W120A, in the resolution range from 1.9 to 2.3
                  A were determined. Nine data sets for these four different mutants were collected, and structural models were refined to R-values
                  ranging from 0.15 to 0.20. The major question addressed here is how these mutations influence the streptavidin binding site
                  and in particular how they affect the binding mode of biotin in the complex. The overall folding of streptavidin was not significantly
                  altered in any of the tryptophan mutants. With one exception, only minor deviations in the unbound structures were observed.
                  In one crystal form of unbound W79F, there is a coupled shift in the side-chains of Phe29 and Tyr43 toward the mutation site,
                  although in a different crystal form these shifts are not observed. In the bound structures, the orientation of biotin in
                  the binding pocket was not significantly altered in the mutant complex. Compared with the wild-type streptavidin-biotin complex,
                  there were no additional crystallographic water molecules observed for any of the mutants in the binding pocket. These structural
                  studies thus suggest that the thermodynamic alterations can be attributed to the local alterations in binding residue composition,
                  rather than a rearrangement of binding site architectures.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_absorption_bru05">Progress in near-field optical spectroscopy research on metal narroparticles demands a better understanding of the role of
                  particle-particle and tip-sample interactions. In this perspective, we investigate theoretically, at a very moderate level
                  of sophistication, the optical behavior of simple silver nanoparticle aggregates, in terms of a formalism involving a multipolar
                  expansion of the fields involved, along with a simplified model for the optical behavior of nanostructures previously developed.
                  In particular, the tip-sample interaction is taken into account roughly, treating the tip as an additional, single particle,
                  characterized by proper dielectric behavior.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_absorption_gen03">In this report we show the possibility of broadband low-pass filters with windows of transparency in pre-set spectral ranges.
                  Those filters are based on the unique optical properties of metal-dielectric composites near the percolation threshold. In
                  such composites, metal clusters of different sizes and shapes have different plasmon resonances and resonate nearly independently
                  at different wavelengths. All together, the resonant plasmon modes cover a very broad spectral range. Applying the effect
                  of spectrally selective photo-modification, we develop a procedure that creates mid-infrared windows of transparency within
                  the broadband filters. We also investigate the possibilities of making low-pass filters composed of spheroids and conductive
                  sticks with certain distributions of aspect ratios.

                  (Os(bpy)(3)(2+)) as phosphorescent labels for the quantification of surface binding of molecules to gold and silver nanoparticles.
                  The fraction of Rtt(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) that is in solution can be distinguished from the surface-bound fraction
                  by the relative lifetimes and integrated emission yields as determined by time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) spectroscopy.
                  Complementary steady-state measurements were carried out to confirm surface attachment of the phosphorescent label molecules.
                  Although the emission of solutions of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) is quenched proportional to the concentration of 10
                  nm Au or 20 nm Ag nanoparticles, the quenching is static and not diffusional quenching observed in Stern-Volmer plots. The
                  results demonstrate that time-resolved spectroscopy provides a rapid method for the measurement of surface binding of labeled
                  molecules on metallic nanoparticles. While steady-state measurements require the preparation of a series of samples with varying
                  quencher concentrations and a reference, the method described herein requires a single sample plus reference. The mechanism
                  for phosphorescence quenching on Au and Ag nanoparticles is discussed in terms of energy and electron transfer theories.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_absorption_str05">In this work we report on the so-called plasmonic enhancement effect, whereby the presence of metallic surfaces or particles
                  in the vicinity of a fluorophore can dramatically alter the fluorescence emission and absorption properties of a fluorophore.
                  The effect, which is associated with the surface plasmon resonance of the metallic surface, depends on parameters such as
                  metal type, particle size, fluorophore type, and fluorophore-particle separation. This work focuses on the creation of metal
                  nanoparticle arrays by a lithographic process and on optimisation strategies to maximise the fluorescence enhancement of dyes
                  in the vicinity of the nanoparticles, for important applications such as fluorescence-based biochip platforms. Ordered arrays
                  of metallic nano-islands were fabricated on glass substrates by a process of natural lithography using monodisperse polystyrene
                  nanospheres. The metal particle dimensions were tailored in order to tune the plasmon resonance wavelength to match the spectral
                  absorption of the fluorophore. The fluorophore, Cy5 dye, which is widely used in optical immunoassays and has a medium quantum
                  efficiency (similar to 0.3), was used in this preliminary study of the plasmonic enhancement effect. The morphology of the
                  metallic arrays was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Absorption and
                  emission spectroscopies were used to elucidate the enhancement effect and its dependence on metal island morphology. Results
                  were correlated with existing theoretical models. The applicability of this important technique to sensor platforms, such
                  as fluorescence-based biochips, is also discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

                  the PL quantum yield of the nanocrystals, the methods used for the synthesis of the nanocrystals, and the temperature for
                  the measurements all did not show detectable influence on the extinction coefficient for a given sized nanocrystal within
                  experimental error.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_acid_leo05">In the present work a new dye, [Ru(dcbpyH2)2(bpy-TPA2)](PF6)2, and the well-known (Bu4N)2[Ru(dcbpyH)2(NCS)2] complex were
                  investigated. The electronic transitions of both dyes showed solvatochromic shifts due to specific interactions of the ligands
                  with the solvent molecules. The surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectra of the dyes dissolved in water, ethanol, and acetonitrile
                  were measured in silver and gold colloidal solutions. The results demonstrate that the dyes were adsorbed on the metallic
                  nanoparticles in different ways for different solvents. It was also found that in the gold colloid, the aqueous solutions
                  of both dyes did not produce any SERS signal, whereas in ethanolic solution the SERS effect was very weak. Deprotonation,
                  H-bonding, and donor-acceptor interactions seem to determine these different behaviors. Our results indicate the important
                  role of the charge-transfer mechanism in SERS.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_acids_alv05">In this work, the role of nanoparticle surface charge in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is examined for the common
                  case of measurements made in colloidal solutions of Ag and Au. Average SERS intensities obtained for several analytes (salicylic
                  acid, pyridine, and 2-naphthalenethiol) on Ag and An colloids are correlated with the pH and zeta potential (xi) values of
                  the nanoparticle solutions from which they were recorded. The consequence of the electrostatic interaction between the analyte
                  and the metallic nanoparticle is stressed. The xi potentials of three commonly used colloidal solutions are reported as a
                  function of pH, and a discussion is given on how these influence SERS intensity. Also examined is the importance of nanoparticle
                  aggregation (and colloidal solution collapse) in determining SERS intensities, and how this varies with the pH of the solution.
                  The results show that SERS enhancement is highest at xi potential values where the colloidal nanoparticle solutions are most
                  stable and where the electrostatic repulsion between the particles and the analyte molecules is minimized. These results suggest
                  some important criteria for consideration in all SERS measurements and also provide important insights into the problem of
                  predicting SERS activities for different molecular systems.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_adsorbates_joh05">We present a general model study of surface-enhanced resonant Raman scattering and fluorescence, focusing on the interplay
                  between electromagnetic (EM) effects and the molecular dynamics as treated by a density matrix calculation. The model molecule
                  has two electronic levels, is affected by radiative and nonradiative damping mechanisms, and a Franck-Condon mechanism yields
                  electron-vibration coupling. The coupling between the molecule and the electromagnetic field is enhanced by placing it between
                  two Ag nanoparticles. The results show that the Raman scattering cross section can, for realistic parameter values, increase
                  by some 10 orders of magnitude (to similar to 10(-14) cm(2)) compared with the free-space case. Also the fluorescence cross
                  section grows with increasing EM enhancement, however, at a slower rate, and this increase eventually stalls when nonradiative
                  decay processes become important. Finally, we find that anti-Stokes Raman scattering is possible with strong incident laser
                  intensities similar to 1 mW/mu m(2).

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_adsorbed_layers_hag04">We model the hybridization kinetics of surface attached DNA oligomers with solubilized targets. Using both master equation
                  and rate equation formalisms, we show that, for surface coverages at which the surface immobilized molecules interact, barriers
                  to penetration create a distribution of target molecule concentrations within the adsorbed layer. By approximately enumerating
                  probe and target conformations, we estimate the probability of overlap between complementary probe and target regions as a
                  function of probe density and chain length. In agreement with experiments, we find that as probe molecules interact more strongly,
                  fewer nucleation sites become accessible and binding rates are diminished relative to those in solution. Nucleation sites
                  near the grafted end of the probes are least accessible; thus targets which preferentially bind to this region show more drastic
                  rate reductions than those that bind near the free end of the probe. The implications of these results for DNA-based biosensors
                  are discussed.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_adsorbed_layers_vie07">A phenomenological model is implemented to study the decay rates of fluorescing molecules in the vicinity of a metallic nanoparticle,
                  wherein the nonlocal optical response of the particle is accounted for via the hydrodynamic model for the description of the
                  free electrons in the metal. These nonlocal effects are examined for each of the radiative rate and the nonradiative rate
                  of the admolecule, respectively. In addition, the overall fluorescence rate which includes the enhancement ratio for the driving
                  field intensity is also studied. It is found that for particles of very small sizes (&lt;10 nm), the nonlocal effects, in general,
                  lead to significantly greater fluorescence rates and smaller nonradiative decay rates for the admolecules, with the effects
                  on radiative rates depending crucially on the orientation of the molecules. Furthermore, the effects are mostly noticeable
                  for molecules close to the metal particle and in processes where higher multipolar interactions are significant such as those
                  in nonradiative decay processes. Above all, these nonlocal effects can still be observable in the presence of large surface
                  damping imposed on the metallic electrons due to the ultrasmall sizes of these nanoparticles. The relevance of these effects
                  to some of the latest experiments is discussed.

                  case of measurements made in colloidal solutions of Ag and Au. Average SERS intensities obtained for several analytes (salicylic
                  acid, pyridine, and 2-naphthalenethiol) on Ag and An colloids are correlated with the pH and zeta potential (xi) values of
                  the nanoparticle solutions from which they were recorded. The consequence of the electrostatic interaction between the analyte
                  and the metallic nanoparticle is stressed. The xi potentials of three commonly used colloidal solutions are reported as a
                  function of pH, and a discussion is given on how these influence SERS intensity. Also examined is the importance of nanoparticle
                  aggregation (and colloidal solution collapse) in determining SERS intensities, and how this varies with the pH of the solution.
                  The results show that SERS enhancement is highest at xi potential values where the colloidal nanoparticle solutions are most
                  stable and where the electrostatic repulsion between the particles and the analyte molecules is minimized. These results suggest
                  some important criteria for consideration in all SERS measurements and also provide important insights into the problem of
                  predicting SERS activities for different molecular systems.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_adsorption_ler06">We address in this paper the long debated issue of the possibility of vibrational pumping under Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering
                  (SERS) conditions, both theoretically and experimentally. We revisit with simple theoretical models the mechanisms of vibrational
                  pumping and its relation to heating. This presentation provides a clear classification of the various regimes of heating/
                  pumping, from simple global laser heating to selective pumping of a single vibrational mode. We also propose the possibility
                  of extreme pumping driven by stimulated phonon emission, and we introduce and apply a new experimental technique to study
                  these effects in SERS. Our method relies on correlations between Raman peak parameters, and cross-correlation for two Raman
                  peaks. We find strong evidence for local and dynamical heating, but no convincing evidence for selective pumping under our
                  specific experimental SERS conditions.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_adsorption_liv85">In this work we shall develop a formalism which extends previous calculations of lifetimes of excited molecular states near
                  planar dielectric surfaces and near single small dielectric particles to situations where the molecule is adsorbed on a cluster
                  made of several dielectric spherical grains. The nonradiative relaxation rate is seen to be relatively weakly dependent on
                  the cluster structure and, if the molecule is adsorbed on one of the grains, is well approximated by the single grain result.
                  The radiative decay rate and hence the quantum yield are much more sensitive to the geometry of the cluster which determines
                  the position (in frequency) of the dielectric resonances of the cluster. The formalism developed here may be used to evaluate
                  local field intensities at different positions within a cluster of dielectric grains under the influence of an external incident
                  field. The Journal of Chemical Physics is copyrighted by The American Institute of Physics.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_adsorption_wei83">The enhancements of normal Raman scattering, resonance Raman scattering, and fluorescence from molecules adsorbed on identical,
                  well-characterized, silver-island films are reported. The enhancement arises from the electromagnetic interaction between
                  the molecules and the electronic plasma resonance of the silver islands. A hierarchy of enhancement ratios is found, with
                  typical values of 105 for RS, 103 for RRS and 10?1 to 10 for fluorescence, depending on the quantum yield of the molecular
                  fluorescence. A model, developed on heuristic grounds and substantiated using the density matrix formalism, describes the
                  light scattering processes and the effects of the plasma resonance. This model presents a unified picture of the surface-induced
                  enhancement effects and is consistent with the experimental values. The comparison of all the forms of optical scattering
                  leads to a complete determination of the role of the plasma resonances in the various portions of the scattering process.
                  The excitation of the electronic plasma resonance results in an increased local field at the molecules leading to an increased
                  excitation or absorption rate. Similarly, the excitation of the plasma resonance by the molecular emission dipole results
                  in an increase in the radiative decay rate. However, the electromagnetic coupling of the molecule to the plasma resonance
                  also adds an additional damping channel which can result in a reduction of the absorption or excitation rate as well as the
                  emission yield. The resultant balance of these processes leads to the hierarchy in the measured enhancements. The hierarchy
                  of enhancements is also shown to have important spectroscopic consequences.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_adsorption_kinetics_xux4">It is well known that surface plasmon absorption (color) of Au nanoparticles highly depends on its size, shape, and surrounding
                  surface environment, providing a great opportunity for the development of Au nanoparticles as a probe for chemical and biochemical
                  sensing and as a building block for nano-optical devices. Currently, it remains incompletely understood how the surface properties
                  of Au nanoparticles ultimately define its optical properties, hindering the progress of rational design of Au nanoparticles
                  for biochemical sensing and assembly of nano-optical devices. Ru(bpy)32+ possesses rich photochemical and electrochemical
                  properties, offering a unique probe to study the surface environment of Au nanoparticles. In this study, we investigate the
                  kinetics of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles (6.5, 19, 48, 97 nm) in the presence of Ru(bpy)32+ at 24.0, 33.0,
                  and 51.0 C. We find that the color-change rate of Au nanoparticles is highly sensitive to the amount of Ru(bpy)32+. In addition,
                  the minimum (critical) concentration of Ru(bpy)32+ needed to change the color of Au nanoparticles is highly dependent upon
                  temperature and nanoparticle size. TEM images illustrate that the color-change mechanism of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+
                  highly depends on the size of nanoparticles. Control experiments using NaCl and MgCl2 to replace Ru(bpy)32+ show no color
                  change, suggesting that the color change of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+ is not solely attributable to the salt
                  effect. Other factors, such as adsorption of Ru(bpy)32+ on the Au nanoparticle surface, may be involved. Moreover, in the
                  presence of the critical concentration of Ru(bpy)32+, as temperature increases from 24.0 C to 51.0 C, the color-change rate
                  of 19 nm Au nanoparticles increases 8-fold, whereas the color-change rate of 48 nm Au nanoparticles decreases 3-fold, showing
                  the temperature dependence of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles in the presence of surface adsorbates, Ru(bpy)32+.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_agglomeration_liv85">In this work we shall develop a formalism which extends previous calculations of lifetimes of excited molecular states near
                  planar dielectric surfaces and near single small dielectric particles to situations where the molecule is adsorbed on a cluster
                  made of several dielectric spherical grains. The nonradiative relaxation rate is seen to be relatively weakly dependent on
                  the cluster structure and, if the molecule is adsorbed on one of the grains, is well approximated by the single grain result.
                  The radiative decay rate and hence the quantum yield are much more sensitive to the geometry of the cluster which determines
                  the position (in frequency) of the dielectric resonances of the cluster. The formalism developed here may be used to evaluate
                  local field intensities at different positions within a cluster of dielectric grains under the influence of an external incident
                  field. The Journal of Chemical Physics is copyrighted by The American Institute of Physics.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_aggregation_fan03">Gold nanoparticles quench the fluorescence of cationic polyfluorene with Stern-Volmer constants (KSV) approaching 1011 M-1,
                  several orders of magnitude larger than any previously reported conjugated polymer-quencher pair and 9-10 orders of magnitude
                  larger than small molecule dye-quencher pairs. The dependence of KSV on ionic strength, charge and conjugation length of the
                  polymer, and the dimensions (and thus optical properties) of the nanoparticles suggests that three factors account for this
                  extraordinary efficiency: (i) amplification of the quenching via rapid internal energy or electron transfer, (ii) electrostatic
                  interactions between the cationic polymer and anionic nanoparticles, and (iii) the ability of gold nanoparticles to quench
                  via efficient energy transfer. As a result of this extraordinarily high KSV, quenching can be observed even at subpicomolar
                  concentrations of nanoparticles, suggesting that the combination of conjugated polymers with these nanomaterials can potentially
                  lead to improved sensitivity in optical biosensors.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_aggregation_sto02">The binding affinity of deoxynucleosides (dA, dG, dC, and dT) to gold nanoparticles was studied using a colorimetric assay
                  to determine if nucleobase sequence may play a role in binding alkanethiol-capped oligonucleotides to gold nanoparticles.
                  These data indicate that the deoxynucleoside dT has a much lower binding affinity to the gold nanoparticle surface than the
                  deoxynucleosides dG, dC, and dA. These data can be correlated with a previous study in our lab which indicated that alkanethiol-capped
                  oligonucleotides containing (dT)20 spacers have a significantly higher surface coverage than oligonucleotides containing (dA)20
                  spacers. To probe the physical consequences of this phenomenon, gold nanoparticles were loaded with alkanethiol-capped poly
                  dT, dA, and dC oligonucleotide sequences of 5-20 bases in length, and the stabilities of the particles in electrolytic media
                  were measured by monitoring a colorimetric change associated with particle agglomeration. The gold nanoparticles loaded with
                  alkanethiol-capped poly dT oligonucleotides exhibited a dramatic increase in stability as the oligonucleotide length was increased
                  from 5 to 20 bases. By comparison, gold nanoparticles loaded with poly dC and poly dA sequences exhibited only a slight increase
                  in stability as the oligonucleotide length was increased. The sequence-dependent stability observed for the DNA-modified gold
                  nanoparticles is attributed to the weaker interaction of the deoxynucleoside dT with the gold nanoparticle surface which results
                  in higher surface coverages and consequently enhanced stability as the oligonucleotide length is increased.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_alkanethiols_asl04a">Biotinylated gold nanoparticles were prepared by using a two-step surface modification procedure. First, a carboxyl-terminated
                  alkanethiol was chemisorbed onto the surface of gold nanoparticles in the presence of a stabilizing agent. Subsequently, the
                  carboxyl groups were reacted with (+)-biotinyl-3,6,9,-trioxaundecanediamine and 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol. This procedure resulted
                  in stable, ligand-modified gold nanoparticles. Upon interaction with streptavidin, the biotinylated gold nanoparticles aggregated
                  by means of specific biomolecular recognition. Their aggregation was studied by optical absorption spectroscopy. Controlled
                  aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles resulted in a shift in the surface plasmon resonance peak and broadening of
                  the absorption spectrum of the nanoparticles. The spectral changes were used to assess the extent of aggregation. Aggregation
                  was found to be dependent on the concentrations of streptavidin, biotinylated gold nanoparticles, and the surface mole fraction
                  of biotin groups on the nanoparticles. Maximum aggregation was observed when 24 nM streptavidin and 0.80 nM biotinylated gold
                  nanoparticles were used. Reversal of nanoparticle aggregation was accomplished by the addition of soluble biotin to the streptavidin-nanoparticle
                  aggregates. Kinetic analysis of the absorbance data showed that streptavidin-induced aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles
                  could be interpreted in terms of a Reaction-Limited Colloidal Aggregation (RLCA) model. This indicates that optical absorption
                  spectroscopy can provide a quantitative measurement of the aggregation process.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_antibody_pow98">Immunoprobes which incorporate both a fluorescent label and a 1.4 nm gold cluster compound were prepared by covalent conjugation
                  to Fab antibody fragments of the Nanogold cluster label followed by a fluorescent moiety. These new immunoconjugates allow
                  the collection of two complementary sets of data, from fluorescence and electron microscopy, from a single labeling experiment.
                  By using Fab fragments, the entire probe is smaller than a whole IgG molecule. A simple fluorescence assay was used to investigate
                  the fluorescence properties of the new probes. They were used to localize the pre-mRNA splicing factor SC35 in the HeLa cell
                  nucleus by both fluorescence and electron microscopy, and also for labeling leukocyte microtubules; labeling was imaged using
                  fluorescence microscopy and, after silver enhancement, by a variety of optical methods and by electron microscopy. Combined
                  Nanogold and Texas Red, Cy3, Lissamine Rhodamine B, and AMCA probes were also prepared, and in preliminary experiments show

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_antigen_receptor_ben05">Membrane topology of receptors plays an important role in shaping transmembrane signalling of cells. Among the methods used
                  for characterizing receptor clusters, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a donor and acceptor fluorophore plays
                  a unique role based on its capability of detecting molecular level (2-10 nm) proximities of receptors in physiological conditions.
                  Recent development of biotechnology has made possible the usage of colloidal gold particles in a large size range for specific
                  labelling of cells for the purposes of electron microscopy. However, by combining metal and fluorophore labelling or cells,
                  the versatility of metal-fluorophore interactions opens the way for new applications by detecting the presence of the metal
                  particles by the methods of fluorescence spectroscopy. An outstanding feature of the metal nanoparticle-fluorophore interaction
                  is that the metal particle can enhance spontaneous emission of the fluorophore in a distance-dependent fashion, in an interaction
                  range esentially determined by the size of the nanoparticle. In our work enhanced fluorescence of rhodamine and cyanine dyes
                  was observed in the vicinity of immunogold nanoparticles on the surface of JY cells in a flow cytometer. The dyes and the
                  immunogold were targetted to the cell surface receptors MHCI, MHCII, transferrin receptor and CD45 by monoclonal antibodies.
                  The fluorescence enhancement was sensitive to the wavelength of the exciting light, the size and amount of surface bound gold
                  beads, as well as the fluorophore-nanoparticle distance. The intensity of 90&amp;DEG; scattering of the incident light beam was
                  enhanced by the immunogold in a concentration and size-dependent fashion. The 90&amp;DEG; light scattering varied with the wavelength
                  of the incident light in a manner characteristic to gold nanoparticles of the applied sizes. A reduction in photobleaching
                  time constant of the cyanine dye was observed in the vicinity of gold particles in a digital imaging microscope. Modulations
                  of 90&amp;DEG; light scattering intensity and photobleaching time constant indicate the role of the local field in the fluorescence
                  enhancement. A mathematical simulation based on the electrodynamic theory of fluorescence enhancement showed a consistency
                  between the measured enhancement values, the inter-epitope distances and the quantum yields. The feasibility of realizing
                  proximity sensors operating at distance ranges larger than that of the conventional Forster transfer is demonstrated on the
                  surface of living cells. Copyright &amp;COPY; 2004 John Wiley&amp; Sons, Ltd.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_aqueous_solution_egg98">The photostability of fluorescent dyes is of crucial importance for the statistical accuracy of single-molecule detection
                  (SMD) and for the image quality of scanning confocal microscopy. Concurrent results for the photostability were obtained by
                  two different experimental techniques. First, the photostabilities of several coumarin and rhodamine derivatives in aqueous
                  solution were obtained by monitoring the steady-state fluorescence decay in a quartz cell. Furthermore, an epi-illuminated
                  microscope, continuous wave (CW) excitation at 514.5 nm, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with a newly developed
                  theory were used to study the photobleaching characteristics of rhodamines under conditions used for SMD. Depending on the
                  rhodamine structure, the probability of photobleaching, pb, is in the order of 10-6-10-7 for irradiances below 103 W/cm2.
                  However, a considerable increase of pb for irradiances above this level was observed which can only be described by photobleaching
                  reactions from higher excited states (two-step photolysis). In view of these observations, the probability of photobleaching,
                  pb, as well as a closed expression of its dependence on the CW excitation irradiance considering a five-level molecular electronic
                  state model with the possibility of photobleaching from higher excited electronic states, is derived. From this model, optimal
                  conditions for SMD with respect to the number of emitted fluorescence photons and to the signal-to-background ratio are discussed,

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_aqueous_solution_kne00">A method has been developed for highly sensitive detection of specific DNA sequences in a homogeneous assay using labeled
                  oligonucleotide molecules in combination with single-molecule photon burst counting and identification. The fluorescently
                  labeled oligonucleotides are called smart probes because they report the presence of complementary target sequences by a strong
                  increase in fluorescence intensity. The smart probes consist of a fluorescent dye attached at the terminus of a hairpin oligonucleotide.
                  The presented technique takes advantage of the fact that the used oxazine dye JA242 is efficiently quenched by complementary
                  guanosine residues. Upon specific hybridization to the target DNA, the smart probe undergoes a conformational change that
                  forces the fluorescent dye and the guanosine residues apart, thereby increasing the fluorescence intensity about six fold
                  in ensemble measurements. To increase the detection sensitivity below the nanomolar range, a confocal fluorescence microscope
                  was used to observe the fluorescence bursts from individual smart probes in the presence and absence of target DNA as they
                  passed through the focused laser beam. Smart probes were excited by a pulsed diode laser emitting at 635 nm with a repetition
                  rate of 64 MHz. Each fluorescence burst was identified by three independent parameters: (a) the burst size, (b) the burst
                  duration, and (c) the fluorescence lifetime. Through the use of this multiparameter analysis, higher discrimination accuracies
                  between smart probes and hybridized probe-target duplexes were achieved. The presented multiparameter detection technique
                  permits the identification of picomolar target DNA concentrations in a homogeneous assay, i.e., the detection of specific
                  DNA sequences in a 200-fold excess of labeled probe molecules.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_array_lij05">In this paper, we had proposed a silicon integrated circuit (IC) compatible DNA-detection platform using photodiode and ordinary
                  optical illumination to detect DNA hybridization events occurred on the chip surface. The method utilizes gold nanoparticle
                  labeling and silver enhancement to generate opaque surface at area with target DNA hybridization. A photodiode fabricated
                  underneath the supporting surface can then be used to detect the light intensity changes, before and after the silver enhancement.
                  With this technique, we have successfully discriminated single base-mismatched DNA from matched DNA sequence, and the detection
                  limit could be as low as 10 pM. By exploiting the advanced modern IC manufacturing technology and the well-established electrochemical
                  immobilization of DNA, this approach has the potential to be used to construct a portable high-density DNA nanoarray system

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_assemblies_san03">Modifying colloidal gold particles with DNA is a new interesting approach in the development of genetic biosensors. Normally
                  the modification is designed to consist of a covalent gold-sulfur bond mediated by a thiol group on one end of a single-stranded
                  oligonucleotide. Here we investigate to what extent the binding actually consists of only the sulfur bridge or if some other
                  nonspecific binding mechanism is present as well. We report on an electrophoresis study showing high amounts of strong, non-thiol-mediated
                  (nonspecific) binding of both single- and double-stranded DNA to gold nanoparticles. Interestingly, even the double strands,
                  lacking interacting groups from the exposed bases of single-stranded DNA, interact nonspecifically with the gold particles.
                  We suggest the mechanism for this to be ion-induced dipole dispersive interactions, where the negatively charged phosphate
                  groups on the DNA induce dipoles in the highly polarizable gold particles. Moreover, we show that particles with nonspecifically
                  adsorbed DNA can be separated from the specifically modified and unmodified ones by gel electrophoresis.

                  id="abstract_atomic_force_microscopy_hud03">A near-field optical imaging approach is demonstrated for simultaneous topographic and spectroscopic imaging with spatial
                  resolution beyond the optical diffraction limit. The method combines metallic-tip-based tapping-mode atomic force microscopy
                  (AFM) with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The AFM metallic tip was formed by sputter coating a Si tapping
                  mode tip with Au, in a way that forms a globular tip apex. Such tip apex generates high local electric field enhancement under
                  laser illumination, which provides a strong electric-field interaction between the AFM tip and the fluorescent molecules under
                  the tip. The tip perturbation of fluorescence gives the fluorescence lifetime changes that provide the AFM-FLIM imaging contrast.
                  A finite element method simulation was used to further evaluate the electric near-field enhancement and electric field distribution
                  originating from the metallic Au-coated AFM tapping-mode tip. We have demonstrated that spatially mapping the change in fluorescence
                  lifetime and intensity is a promising approach to spectroscopic imaging at an AFM spatial resolution typically defined by
                  the apex diameter of the AFM tips. The globular Au-coated AFM tip not only gives adequate spatial AFM tapping-mode imaging
                  spatial resolution but also is "environmentally friendly" to soft samples, such as polymeric dye-labeled nanospheres and even
                  biological specimens such as POPO-3 labeled DNA.

                  for imaging biological and nanoscale systems. To achieve optical imaging at high spatial resolution beyond the diffraction
                  limit, aperture-less metallic scanning tips have been utilized to enhance the laser illumination local electromagnetic field

                  to first applications in materials science and life sciences. In this review some recent biological applications of colloidal
                  nanocrystals are discussed, without going into biological or chemical details. First, the properties of colloidal nanocrystals
                  and how they can be synthesized are described. Second, the conjugation of nanocrystals with biological molecules is discussed.
                  And third, three different biological applications are introduced: (i) the arrangement of nanocrystal-oligonucleotide conjugates
                  using molecular scaffolds such as single-stranded DNA, (ii) the use of nanocrystal-protein conjugates as fluorescent probes
                  for cellular imaging, and (iii) a motility assay based on the uptake of nanocrystals by living cells.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_au_nanoparticles_xux4">It is well known that surface plasmon absorption (color) of Au nanoparticles highly depends on its size, shape, and surrounding
                  surface environment, providing a great opportunity for the development of Au nanoparticles as a probe for chemical and biochemical
                  sensing and as a building block for nano-optical devices. Currently, it remains incompletely understood how the surface properties
                  of Au nanoparticles ultimately define its optical properties, hindering the progress of rational design of Au nanoparticles
                  for biochemical sensing and assembly of nano-optical devices. Ru(bpy)32+ possesses rich photochemical and electrochemical
                  properties, offering a unique probe to study the surface environment of Au nanoparticles. In this study, we investigate the
                  kinetics of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles (6.5, 19, 48, 97 nm) in the presence of Ru(bpy)32+ at 24.0, 33.0,
                  and 51.0 C. We find that the color-change rate of Au nanoparticles is highly sensitive to the amount of Ru(bpy)32+. In addition,
                  the minimum (critical) concentration of Ru(bpy)32+ needed to change the color of Au nanoparticles is highly dependent upon
                  temperature and nanoparticle size. TEM images illustrate that the color-change mechanism of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+
                  highly depends on the size of nanoparticles. Control experiments using NaCl and MgCl2 to replace Ru(bpy)32+ show no color
                  change, suggesting that the color change of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+ is not solely attributable to the salt
                  effect. Other factors, such as adsorption of Ru(bpy)32+ on the Au nanoparticle surface, may be involved. Moreover, in the
                  presence of the critical concentration of Ru(bpy)32+, as temperature increases from 24.0 C to 51.0 C, the color-change rate
                  of 19 nm Au nanoparticles increases 8-fold, whereas the color-change rate of 48 nm Au nanoparticles decreases 3-fold, showing
                  the temperature dependence of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles in the presence of surface adsorbates, Ru(bpy)32+.

                  was developed. CL-Sepharose was activated with p-nitrophenyl chloroformate, and the resultant carbonate derivative was reacted
                  with diaminohexane. Subsequent reaction of the amino-containing resin with iminobiotin-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (in an organic
                  solvent) yielded the stable affinity resin. The capacity of this resin for either avidin of streptavidin was 12 mg per ml
                  resin, and streptavidin could be purified in one step directly from the culture broth of Streptomyces avidinii. The biotin-binding
                  protein isolated in this manner exhibited a major band at about 75 kDa and a minor band at about 150 kDa. Under denaturing
                  conditions, a spectrum of subunit molecular weights ranging between 15 and 19 kDa was detected, the distributiob of which
                  depended upon the specific preparation.

                  oligonucleotide molecules in combination with single-molecule photon burst counting and identification. The fluorescently
                  labeled oligonucleotides are called smart probes because they report the presence of complementary target sequences by a strong
                  increase in fluorescence intensity. The smart probes consist of a fluorescent dye attached at the terminus of a hairpin oligonucleotide.
                  The presented technique takes advantage of the fact that the used oxazine dye JA242 is efficiently quenched by complementary
                  guanosine residues. Upon specific hybridization to the target DNA, the smart probe undergoes a conformational change that
                  forces the fluorescent dye and the guanosine residues apart, thereby increasing the fluorescence intensity about six fold
                  in ensemble measurements. To increase the detection sensitivity below the nanomolar range, a confocal fluorescence microscope
                  was used to observe the fluorescence bursts from individual smart probes in the presence and absence of target DNA as they
                  passed through the focused laser beam. Smart probes were excited by a pulsed diode laser emitting at 635 nm with a repetition
                  rate of 64 MHz. Each fluorescence burst was identified by three independent parameters: (a) the burst size, (b) the burst
                  duration, and (c) the fluorescence lifetime. Through the use of this multiparameter analysis, higher discrimination accuracies
                  between smart probes and hybridized probe-target duplexes were achieved. The presented multiparameter detection technique
                  permits the identification of picomolar target DNA concentrations in a homogeneous assay, i.e., the detection of specific
                  DNA sequences in a 200-fold excess of labeled probe molecules.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_beam_splitter_bau02">Using particle tracking routines the location of single point light sources can be determined with an accuracy of a few nanometers.
                  By using quantum dots (QDs) emitting at different wavelengths, the measurement of the distance between these point light sources,
                  which are closer than the optical resolution of 200 nm, was achieved. The nanocrystals have major advantages over conventional
                  chromophores in higher quantum yield, more photostability, and the possibility of different emission wavelengths by an excitation
                  with a single wavelength. The colocalization of two single QDs at the least distance of 40 nm can be measured with a standard
                  deviation of 5 nm and a time resolution of 117 ms using one excitation wavelength.

                  (Os(bpy)(3)(2+)) as phosphorescent labels for the quantification of surface binding of molecules to gold and silver nanoparticles.
                  The fraction of Rtt(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) that is in solution can be distinguished from the surface-bound fraction
                  by the relative lifetimes and integrated emission yields as determined by time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) spectroscopy.
                  Complementary steady-state measurements were carried out to confirm surface attachment of the phosphorescent label molecules.
                  Although the emission of solutions of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) is quenched proportional to the concentration of 10
                  nm Au or 20 nm Ag nanoparticles, the quenching is static and not diffusional quenching observed in Stern-Volmer plots. The
                  results demonstrate that time-resolved spectroscopy provides a rapid method for the measurement of surface binding of labeled
                  molecules on metallic nanoparticles. While steady-state measurements require the preparation of a series of samples with varying
                  quencher concentrations and a reference, the method described herein requires a single sample plus reference. The mechanism
                  for phosphorescence quenching on Au and Ag nanoparticles is discussed in terms of energy and electron transfer theories.

                  id="abstract_biological_applications_asl05">Gold colloids are well known to display strong plasmon absorption bands due to electron oscillations induced by the incident
                  light. When the colloids are in proximity, the plasmon absorption bands are often perturbed. This has enabled us recently
                  to successfully develop a glucose sensing platform based on the disassociation of dextrancoated gold colloids, cross-linked
                  with Con A, by glucose. However, a much more useful and simpler property of gold colloids, which has been ill explored with
                  regard to sensing, is their ability to efficiently scatter excitation fight. We have found that our nanogold sensing aggregates
                  are indeed efficient light scatters around the nanogold plasmon absorption band. By measuring the ratio of scattered fight
                  intensities at two different arbitrary wavelengths, 560 and 680 nm, glucose concentrations can be readily determined from
                  a few millimolar up to similar to 60 mM, using a simple white light LED and detection system. Further, by measuring the ratio
                  of the scattered intensities, this sensing approach is independent of the total sensing aggregate concentration and the excitation
                  and detection instrumentation fluctuations or drifts. This simplistic and low-cost approach to glucose sensing, coupled with
                  the sensing aggreagates' ability to scatter red light, suggests the potential use of these aggregates for use in physiological
                  transdermal glucose monitoring, either for implantable skin sensors or glucose sensing tattoos (discussed later).

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_biological_techniques_hud03">A near-field optical imaging approach is demonstrated for simultaneous topographic and spectroscopic imaging with spatial
                  resolution beyond the optical diffraction limit. The method combines metallic-tip-based tapping-mode atomic force microscopy
                  (AFM) with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The AFM metallic tip was formed by sputter coating a Si tapping
                  mode tip with Au, in a way that forms a globular tip apex. Such tip apex generates high local electric field enhancement under
                  laser illumination, which provides a strong electric-field interaction between the AFM tip and the fluorescent molecules under
                  the tip. The tip perturbation of fluorescence gives the fluorescence lifetime changes that provide the AFM-FLIM imaging contrast.
                  A finite element method simulation was used to further evaluate the electric near-field enhancement and electric field distribution
                  originating from the metallic Au-coated AFM tapping-mode tip. We have demonstrated that spatially mapping the change in fluorescence
                  lifetime and intensity is a promising approach to spectroscopic imaging at an AFM spatial resolution typically defined by
                  the apex diameter of the AFM tips. The globular Au-coated AFM tip not only gives adequate spatial AFM tapping-mode imaging
                  spatial resolution but also is "environmentally friendly" to soft samples, such as polymeric dye-labeled nanospheres and even
                  biological specimens such as POPO-3 labeled DNA.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_biosensors_fan03">Gold nanoparticles quench the fluorescence of cationic polyfluorene with Stern-Volmer constants (KSV) approaching 1011 M-1,
                  several orders of magnitude larger than any previously reported conjugated polymer-quencher pair and 9-10 orders of magnitude
                  larger than small molecule dye-quencher pairs. The dependence of KSV on ionic strength, charge and conjugation length of the
                  polymer, and the dimensions (and thus optical properties) of the nanoparticles suggests that three factors account for this
                  extraordinary efficiency: (i) amplification of the quenching via rapid internal energy or electron transfer, (ii) electrostatic
                  interactions between the cationic polymer and anionic nanoparticles, and (iii) the ability of gold nanoparticles to quench
                  via efficient energy transfer. As a result of this extraordinarily high KSV, quenching can be observed even at subpicomolar
                  concentrations of nanoparticles, suggesting that the combination of conjugated polymers with these nanomaterials can potentially
                  lead to improved sensitivity in optical biosensors.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_biotechnology_egg98">The photostability of fluorescent dyes is of crucial importance for the statistical accuracy of single-molecule detection
                  (SMD) and for the image quality of scanning confocal microscopy. Concurrent results for the photostability were obtained by
                  two different experimental techniques. First, the photostabilities of several coumarin and rhodamine derivatives in aqueous
                  solution were obtained by monitoring the steady-state fluorescence decay in a quartz cell. Furthermore, an epi-illuminated
                  microscope, continuous wave (CW) excitation at 514.5 nm, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with a newly developed
                  theory were used to study the photobleaching characteristics of rhodamines under conditions used for SMD. Depending on the
                  rhodamine structure, the probability of photobleaching, pb, is in the order of 10-6-10-7 for irradiances below 103 W/cm2.
                  However, a considerable increase of pb for irradiances above this level was observed which can only be described by photobleaching
                  reactions from higher excited states (two-step photolysis). In view of these observations, the probability of photobleaching,
                  pb, as well as a closed expression of its dependence on the CW excitation irradiance considering a five-level molecular electronic
                  state model with the possibility of photobleaching from higher excited electronic states, is derived. From this model, optimal
                  conditions for SMD with respect to the number of emitted fluorescence photons and to the signal-to-background ratio are discussed,
                  taking into account both saturation and photobleaching. The additional photobleaching due to two-step photolysis limits the
                  applicable irradiance.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_biotin_fre98">Previous thermodynamic and computational studies have pointed to the important energetic role of aromatic contacts in generating
                  the exceptional binding free energy of streptavidin-biotin association. We report here the crystallographic characterization
                  of single site tryptophan mutants in investigating structural consequences of alterations in these aromatic contacts. Four
                  tryptophan residues, Trp79, Trp92, Trp108 and Trp120, play an important role in the hydrophobic binding contributions, which
                  along with a hydrogen bonding network and a flexible binding loop give rise to tight ligand binding (KaÂ 1013M-1). The crystal
                  structures of ligand-free and biotin-bound mutants, W79F, W108F, W120F and W120A, in the resolution range from 1.9 to 2.3
                  A were determined. Nine data sets for these four different mutants were collected, and structural models were refined to R-values
                  ranging from 0.15 to 0.20. The major question addressed here is how these mutations influence the streptavidin binding site
                  and in particular how they affect the binding mode of biotin in the complex. The overall folding of streptavidin was not significantly
                  altered in any of the tryptophan mutants. With one exception, only minor deviations in the unbound structures were observed.
                  In one crystal form of unbound W79F, there is a coupled shift in the side-chains of Phe29 and Tyr43 toward the mutation site,
                  although in a different crystal form these shifts are not observed. In the bound structures, the orientation of biotin in
                  the binding pocket was not significantly altered in the mutant complex. Compared with the wild-type streptavidin-biotin complex,
                  there were no additional crystallographic water molecules observed for any of the mutants in the binding pocket. These structural
                  studies thus suggest that the thermodynamic alterations can be attributed to the local alterations in binding residue composition,
                  rather than a rearrangement of binding site architectures.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_biotin_binding_mar03">Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements were performed to elucidate the fluorescence quenching of oxazine,
                  rhodamine, carbocyanine, and bora-diaza-indacene dyes by amino acids. Among the natural amino acids, tryptophan exhibits the
                  most pronounced quenching efficiency. Especially, the red-absorbing dyes ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine derivative MR
                  121 are strongly quenched almost exclusively by tryptophan due to the formation of weak or nonfluorescent ground-state complexes
                  with association constants, Kass., ranging from 96 to 206 M-1. Rhodamine, fluorescein, and bora-diaza-indacene derivatives
                  that absorb at shorter wavelengths are also quenched substantially by tyrosine residues. The quenching of carbocyanine dyes,
                  such as Cy5, and Alexa 647 by amino acids can be almost neglected. While quenching of ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine
                  derivative MR121 by tryptophan is dominated by static quenching, dynamic quenching is more efficient for the two bora-diaza-indacene
                  dyes Bodipy-FL and Bodipy630/650. Labeling of the dyes to tryptophan, tryptophan-containing peptides, and proteins (streptavidin)
                  demonstrates that knowledge of these fluorescence quenching processes is crucial for the development of fluorescence-based
                  diagnostic assays. Changes in the fluorescence quantum yield of dye-labeled peptides and proteins might be used advantageously
                  for the quantification of proteases and specific binding partners.

                  id="abstract_boundary_elements_methods_and04">We present a model to evaluate the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of electronic excited states of a molecule close to
                  a metal particle of complex shape and, possibly, in the presence of a solvent. The molecule is treated quantum mechanically
                  at Hartree?Fock (HF) or density-functional theory (DFT) level. The metal/solvent is considered as a continuous body, characterized
                  by its frequency dependent local dielectric constant. For simple metal shapes (planar infinite surface and spherical particle)
                  a version of the polarizable continuum model based on the integral equation formalism has been used, while an alternative
                  methodology has been implemented to treat metal particles of arbitrary shape. In both cases, equations have been numerically
                  solved using a boundary element method. Excitation energies and nonradiative decay rates due to the energy transfer from the
                  molecule to the metal are evaluated exploiting the linear response theory (TDHF or TDDFT where TD?time dependent). The radiative
                  decay rate of the whole system (molecule+metal/solvent) is calculated, still using a continuum model, in terms of the response
                  of the surrounding to the molecular transition. The model presented has been applied to the study of the radiative and nonradiative
                  lifetimes of a lissamine molecule in solution (water) and close to gold spherical nanoparticles of different radius. In addition,
                  the influence of the metal shape has been analyzed by performing calculations on a system composed by a coumarin-type molecule
                  close to silver aggregates of complex shape.

                  id="abstract_boundary_elements_methods_cor03">We present a model for the evaluation of the metal-induced deexcitation rate for molecules close to a metal surface. In this
                  model, the molecule is treated quantum mechanically at the density-functional theory level and its excitations with a time-dependent
                  density-functional theory procedure. The metal is described through its dielectric response properties. The nonlocal features
                  of such a response are taken into account by using a modified Lindhard-Mermin dielectric constant. The presence of small random
                  roughness on the metal surface is described with the model of Rahman and Maradudin [Phys. Rev. B 21, 504 (1980)]. Systems
                  in which the molecule close to the metal is immersed in an homogeneous matrix or deposited on a spacer are considered. The
                  matrix and the spacer are treated with the polarizable continuum model. The molecule-metal and the molecule-matrix (or molecule-spacer)
                  electrostatic interactions are described by using the integral equation formalism, numerically treated with a boundary element
                  method. As a test case, the method has been applied to the study of phosphorescence from biacetyl close to a silver surface
                  and immersed in or deposited on solid ammonia. Our results show that nonlocal metal response and surface roughness have an
                  important role in explaining measured lifetimes.

                  is improved significantly, due to a dramatic decrease of the fluorescence lifetime caused by the strong electromagnetic interaction
                  between the emitting molecule and the metal layer. Moreover, the metal shell enhances the exciting electric field intensity

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_c_reactive_protein_sey05">Efforts to improve the performance of immunoassays and immunosensors by incorporating different kinds of nanostructures have
                  gained considerable momentum over the last decade. Apart from liposomes, which will not be discussed here, most groups focus
                  on artificial, particulate marker systems, both organic and inorganic. The underlying detection procedures may be based either
                  on electro-magnetical or optical techniques. This review will be confined to the latter only, comprising nanoparticle applications
                  generating signals as diverse as static and time-resolved luminescence, one- and two-photon absorption, Raman and Rayleigh
                  scattering as well as surface plasmon resonance and others. In general, all endeavors cited are geared to achieve one or more
                  of the following goals: lowering of detection limits (if possible, down to single-molecule level), parallel integration of
                  multiple signals (multiplexing), signal amplification by several orders of magnitude and prevention of photobleaching effects
                  with concomitant maintenance of antigen binding specificity and sensitivity. Inorganic nanoparticle labels based on noble
                  metals, semiconductor quantum dots and nanoshells appear to be the most versatile systems for these bioanalytical applications

                  attached to silver and gold nanoclusters. Strongly enhanced and highly confined local optical fields enable surface-enhanced

                  large effective cross sections in two-photon excited Raman spectroscopy. The ability for very sensitive and spatially confined
                  molecular structural probing makes gold and silver nanoclusters very promising tools for studies of small structures in biological

                  performing anti-Stokes/Stokes ratio measurements over a large spatial area and low power density, down to 10 K with dried
                  silver colloids, the dye rhodamine 6G, and 676 nm laser excitation. The method we propose allows for the measurement of the

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_carrier_lifetime_far05">The interaction of a single quantum dot with a bowtie antenna is demonstrated for visible light. The antenna is generated
                  at the apex of a Si3N4 atomic force microscopy tip by focused ion beam milling. When scanned over the quantum dot, its photoluminescence
                  is enhanced while its excited-state lifetime is decreased. Our observations demonstrate that the relaxation channels of a
                  single quantum emitter can be controlled by coupling to an efficiently radiating metallic nanoantenna.

                  id="abstract_cell_surface_receptors_par03a">Due to their interesting properties, research on colloidal nanocrystals has moved in the last few years from fundamental research
                  to first applications in materials science and life sciences. In this review some recent biological applications of colloidal
                  nanocrystals are discussed, without going into biological or chemical details. First, the properties of colloidal nanocrystals
                  and how they can be synthesized are described. Second, the conjugation of nanocrystals with biological molecules is discussed.
                  And third, three different biological applications are introduced: (i) the arrangement of nanocrystal-oligonucleotide conjugates
                  using molecular scaffolds such as single-stranded DNA, (ii) the use of nanocrystal-protein conjugates as fluorescent probes
                  for cellular imaging, and (iii) a motility assay based on the uptake of nanocrystals by living cells.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_cells_xux4">It is well known that surface plasmon absorption (color) of Au nanoparticles highly depends on its size, shape, and surrounding
                  surface environment, providing a great opportunity for the development of Au nanoparticles as a probe for chemical and biochemical
                  sensing and as a building block for nano-optical devices. Currently, it remains incompletely understood how the surface properties
                  of Au nanoparticles ultimately define its optical properties, hindering the progress of rational design of Au nanoparticles
                  for biochemical sensing and assembly of nano-optical devices. Ru(bpy)32+ possesses rich photochemical and electrochemical
                  properties, offering a unique probe to study the surface environment of Au nanoparticles. In this study, we investigate the
                  kinetics of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles (6.5, 19, 48, 97 nm) in the presence of Ru(bpy)32+ at 24.0, 33.0,
                  and 51.0 C. We find that the color-change rate of Au nanoparticles is highly sensitive to the amount of Ru(bpy)32+. In addition,
                  the minimum (critical) concentration of Ru(bpy)32+ needed to change the color of Au nanoparticles is highly dependent upon
                  temperature and nanoparticle size. TEM images illustrate that the color-change mechanism of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+
                  highly depends on the size of nanoparticles. Control experiments using NaCl and MgCl2 to replace Ru(bpy)32+ show no color
                  change, suggesting that the color change of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+ is not solely attributable to the salt
                  effect. Other factors, such as adsorption of Ru(bpy)32+ on the Au nanoparticle surface, may be involved. Moreover, in the
                  presence of the critical concentration of Ru(bpy)32+, as temperature increases from 24.0 C to 51.0 C, the color-change rate
                  of 19 nm Au nanoparticles increases 8-fold, whereas the color-change rate of 48 nm Au nanoparticles decreases 3-fold, showing
                  the temperature dependence of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles in the presence of surface adsorbates, Ru(bpy)32+.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_charge_fan03">Gold nanoparticles quench the fluorescence of cationic polyfluorene with Stern-Volmer constants (KSV) approaching 1011 M-1,
                  several orders of magnitude larger than any previously reported conjugated polymer-quencher pair and 9-10 orders of magnitude
                  larger than small molecule dye-quencher pairs. The dependence of KSV on ionic strength, charge and conjugation length of the
                  polymer, and the dimensions (and thus optical properties) of the nanoparticles suggests that three factors account for this
                  extraordinary efficiency: (i) amplification of the quenching via rapid internal energy or electron transfer, (ii) electrostatic
                  interactions between the cationic polymer and anionic nanoparticles, and (iii) the ability of gold nanoparticles to quench
                  via efficient energy transfer. As a result of this extraordinarily high KSV, quenching can be observed even at subpicomolar
                  concentrations of nanoparticles, suggesting that the combination of conjugated polymers with these nanomaterials can potentially
                  lead to improved sensitivity in optical biosensors.

                  The fraction of Rtt(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) that is in solution can be distinguished from the surface-bound fraction
                  by the relative lifetimes and integrated emission yields as determined by time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) spectroscopy.
                  Complementary steady-state measurements were carried out to confirm surface attachment of the phosphorescent label molecules.
                  Although the emission of solutions of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) is quenched proportional to the concentration of 10
                  nm Au or 20 nm Ag nanoparticles, the quenching is static and not diffusional quenching observed in Stern-Volmer plots. The
                  results demonstrate that time-resolved spectroscopy provides a rapid method for the measurement of surface binding of labeled
                  molecules on metallic nanoparticles. While steady-state measurements require the preparation of a series of samples with varying
                  quencher concentrations and a reference, the method described herein requires a single sample plus reference. The mechanism
                  for phosphorescence quenching on Au and Ag nanoparticles is discussed in terms of energy and electron transfer theories.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_charge_transfer_mar03">Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements were performed to elucidate the fluorescence quenching of oxazine,
                  rhodamine, carbocyanine, and bora-diaza-indacene dyes by amino acids. Among the natural amino acids, tryptophan exhibits the
                  most pronounced quenching efficiency. Especially, the red-absorbing dyes ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine derivative MR
                  121 are strongly quenched almost exclusively by tryptophan due to the formation of weak or nonfluorescent ground-state complexes
                  with association constants, Kass., ranging from 96 to 206 M-1. Rhodamine, fluorescein, and bora-diaza-indacene derivatives
                  that absorb at shorter wavelengths are also quenched substantially by tyrosine residues. The quenching of carbocyanine dyes,
                  such as Cy5, and Alexa 647 by amino acids can be almost neglected. While quenching of ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine
                  derivative MR121 by tryptophan is dominated by static quenching, dynamic quenching is more efficient for the two bora-diaza-indacene
                  dyes Bodipy-FL and Bodipy630/650. Labeling of the dyes to tryptophan, tryptophan-containing peptides, and proteins (streptavidin)
                  demonstrates that knowledge of these fluorescence quenching processes is crucial for the development of fluorescence-based
                  diagnostic assays. Changes in the fluorescence quantum yield of dye-labeled peptides and proteins might be used advantageously
                  for the quantification of proteases and specific binding partners.

                  investigated. The electronic transitions of both dyes showed solvatochromic shifts due to specific interactions of the ligands
                  with the solvent molecules. The surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectra of the dyes dissolved in water, ethanol, and acetonitrile
                  were measured in silver and gold colloidal solutions. The results demonstrate that the dyes were adsorbed on the metallic
                  nanoparticles in different ways for different solvents. It was also found that in the gold colloid, the aqueous solutions
                  of both dyes did not produce any SERS signal, whereas in ethanolic solution the SERS effect was very weak. Deprotonation,
                  H-bonding, and donor-acceptor interactions seem to determine these different behaviors. Our results indicate the important
                  role of the charge-transfer mechanism in SERS.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_chemical_sensors_fan03">Gold nanoparticles quench the fluorescence of cationic polyfluorene with Stern-Volmer constants (KSV) approaching 1011 M-1,
                  several orders of magnitude larger than any previously reported conjugated polymer-quencher pair and 9-10 orders of magnitude
                  larger than small molecule dye-quencher pairs. The dependence of KSV on ionic strength, charge and conjugation length of the
                  polymer, and the dimensions (and thus optical properties) of the nanoparticles suggests that three factors account for this
                  extraordinary efficiency: (i) amplification of the quenching via rapid internal energy or electron transfer, (ii) electrostatic
                  interactions between the cationic polymer and anionic nanoparticles, and (iii) the ability of gold nanoparticles to quench
                  via efficient energy transfer. As a result of this extraordinarily high KSV, quenching can be observed even at subpicomolar
                  concentrations of nanoparticles, suggesting that the combination of conjugated polymers with these nanomaterials can potentially
                  lead to improved sensitivity in optical biosensors.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_chemical_sensors_soe00">We have developed a simple, fast, and flexible technique to measure optical scattering spectra of individual metallic nanoparticles.
                  The particles are placed in an evanescent field produced by total internal reflection of light from a halogen lamp in a glass
                  prism. The light scattered by individual particles is collected using a conventional microscope and is spectrally analyzed
                  by a nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled-device array coupled to a spectrometer. This technique is employed to measure the effect
                  of particle diameter on the dephasing time of the particle plasmon resonance in gold nanoparticles. We also demonstrate the
                  use of this technique for measurements in liquids, which is important for the potential application of particle plasmons in
                  chemical or biological nanosensors.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_chiral_spheres_mor05">Fast and numerically stable transfer-matrix solution is presented for the classical electromagnetics problem of a dipole radiating
                  inside and outside a stratified sphere consisting of concentric spherical shells. There is no limitation on the dipole position,
                  the number of the concentric shells, the shell medium, or on the sphere radius. Electromagnetic fields are determined anywhere
                  in the space, the time-averaged angular distribution of the radiated power, the total radiated power, Ohmic losses due to
                  an absorbing shell, and Green?s function are calculated. An absorbing, optically active, and ultrathin (less, approximate10
                  nm) metallic shell (core), characterized by a nonlocal dielectric function, are all allowed. The classical results are then
                  applied to inelastic light scattering (fluorescence and Raman), the radiative and nonradiative normalized decay rates, and
                  frequency shift. Using correspondence principle, the radiative decay rate is calculated from the Poynting vector, whereas
                  the nonradiative decay rate is calculated from the Ohmic losses inside a sphere absorptive shell. Numerical stability of our
                  method and limitations of classical description of decay rates are addressed. The importance of grouping various radiative
                  and nonradiative decay mechanisms into local and nonlocal decay rates is emphasized. Further possible extensions of the theory
                  presented here to the case of an arbitrary multilayered (axially symmetric) particle and to the classical problem of a radiating
                  quadrupole in the presence of a multilayered particle are briefly outlined. Various applications for chemical speciation,
                  LIDAR, fluorescent microscopy, engineering of decay rates, identification of biological particles, and monitoring specific
                  cell functions are envisaged. Computer program is freely available at http://www.wave-scattering.com.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_cluster_pow97">Immunoprobes that combine a fluorescent label with a 1.4-nm gold cluster compound have been prepared by covalent conjugation
                  with polyclonal antibody Fab' fragments. These new immunoconjugates allow the collection of two complementary sets of data,
                  from fluorescence and electron microscopy, from a single labeling experiment. We find that incorporation of one or more fluorescein
                  moieties into the coordinated ligands of the 1.4-nm Nanogold gold cluster label yields a stable, dual-function immunolabel
                  in which fluorescence quenching is negligible. In a second synthetic strategy, Nanogold and fluorescein were separately covalently
                  conjugated to Fab' fragments to yield a probe with very similar properties. With the use of Fab' fragments, the entire probe
                  is smaller than a whole IgG molecule, and it exhibited excellent penetration properties. It was used to localize the pre-mRNA
                  splicing factor SC35 in the HeLa cell nucleus by both fluorescence and electron microscopy.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_cluster_pow98">Immunoprobes which incorporate both a fluorescent label and a 1.4 nm gold cluster compound were prepared by covalent conjugation
                  to Fab antibody fragments of the Nanogold cluster label followed by a fluorescent moiety. These new immunoconjugates allow
                  the collection of two complementary sets of data, from fluorescence and electron microscopy, from a single labeling experiment.
                  By using Fab fragments, the entire probe is smaller than a whole IgG molecule. A simple fluorescence assay was used to investigate
                  the fluorescence properties of the new probes. They were used to localize the pre-mRNA splicing factor SC35 in the HeLa cell
                  nucleus by both fluorescence and electron microscopy, and also for labeling leukocyte microtubules; labeling was imaged using
                  fluorescence microscopy and, after silver enhancement, by a variety of optical methods and by electron microscopy. Combined
                  Nanogold and Texas Red, Cy3, Lissamine Rhodamine B, and AMCA probes were also prepared, and in preliminary experiments show
                  similar properties to the combined fluorescein and gold cluster probes. The fluorescent and gold cluster probes enable a new
                  degree of correlation between fluorescence and electron microscopy, and may also be used to check labeling of specimens before
                  processing for electron microscopy.

                  particle-particle and tip-sample interactions. In this perspective, we investigate theoretically, at a very moderate level
                  of sophistication, the optical behavior of simple silver nanoparticle aggregates, in terms of a formalism involving a multipolar
                  expansion of the fields involved, along with a simplified model for the optical behavior of nanostructures previously developed.
                  In particular, the tip-sample interaction is taken into account roughly, treating the tip as an additional, single particle,
                  characterized by proper dielectric behavior.

                  clusters, as evidenced by the shift of their surface plasmon (SP) band from 512 to ca. 600 nm. The presence of carboxylate
                  ester functions on the dithiol allows its cleavage by addition of a cleaving agent, such as hydrazine. The cleavage process
                  results in the breaking down of the clusters of nanoparticles and the shift of the SP band back to lower wavelengths. Further
                  addition of dithiol causes the formation of the clusters again. The aggregation/deaggregation process may be monitored visually
                  by following the color change from pink-red to purple and vice versa in the forward and backward steps, respectively.

                  of colloidal gold in the middle 1800s. More recently, new lithographic techniques as well as improvements to classical wet
                  chemistry methods have made it possible to synthesize noble metal nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes, shapes, and dielectric
                  environments. In this feature article, we describe recent progress in the theory of nanoparticle optical properties, particularly
                  methods for solving Maxwell's equations for light scattering from particles of arbitrary shape in a complex environment. Included
                  is a description of the qualitative features of dipole and quadrupole plasmon resonances for spherical particles; a discussion
                  of analytical and numerical methods for calculating extinction and scattering cross-sections, local fields, and other optical
                  properties for nonspherical particles; and a survey of applications to problems of recent interest involving triangular silver

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_colloidal_gold_asl04a">Biotinylated gold nanoparticles were prepared by using a two-step surface modification procedure. First, a carboxyl-terminated
                  alkanethiol was chemisorbed onto the surface of gold nanoparticles in the presence of a stabilizing agent. Subsequently, the
                  carboxyl groups were reacted with (+)-biotinyl-3,6,9,-trioxaundecanediamine and 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol. This procedure resulted
                  in stable, ligand-modified gold nanoparticles. Upon interaction with streptavidin, the biotinylated gold nanoparticles aggregated
                  by means of specific biomolecular recognition. Their aggregation was studied by optical absorption spectroscopy. Controlled
                  aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles resulted in a shift in the surface plasmon resonance peak and broadening of
                  the absorption spectrum of the nanoparticles. The spectral changes were used to assess the extent of aggregation. Aggregation
                  was found to be dependent on the concentrations of streptavidin, biotinylated gold nanoparticles, and the surface mole fraction
                  of biotin groups on the nanoparticles. Maximum aggregation was observed when 24 nM streptavidin and 0.80 nM biotinylated gold
                  nanoparticles were used. Reversal of nanoparticle aggregation was accomplished by the addition of soluble biotin to the streptavidin-nanoparticle
                  aggregates. Kinetic analysis of the absorbance data showed that streptavidin-induced aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles
                  could be interpreted in terms of a Reaction-Limited Colloidal Aggregation (RLCA) model. This indicates that optical absorption
                  spectroscopy can provide a quantitative measurement of the aggregation process.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_colloidal_gold_hai00">Recent advances in gold technology have led to probes with improved properties and performance for cell biologists: higher
                  labeling density, better sensitivity, and greater penetration into tissues. Gold clusters, such as the 1.4-nm Nanogold, are
                  gold compounds that can be covalently linked to Fab' antibody fragments, making small and stable probes. Silver enhancement
                  then makes these small gold particles easily visible by EM, LM, and directly by eye. Another advance is the combination of
                  fluorescent and gold probes for correlative microscopy. Chemical crosslinking of gold particles to many biologically active
                  molecules has made possible many novel probes, such as gold?lipids, gold?Ni?NTA, and gold?ATP.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_colloidal_gold_ohe05">An inhibition assay method was developed based on the modulation in the FRET efficiency between quantum dots (QDs) and gold
                  nanoparticles (AuNPs) in the presence of the molecules which inhibit the interactions between QD- and AuNP-conjugated biomolecules.
                  For the functionalization, AuNPs were first stabilized by chemisorption of n-alkanethiols and then capped with the first generation
                  polyamidoamine (G1 PAMAM) dendrimers. By employing a streptavidin-biotin couple as a model system, avidin was quantitatively
                  analyzed as an inhibitor by sensing the change in photoluminescence (PL) quenching of SA-QDs by biotin-AuNPs. The detection
                  limit for avidin was about 10 nM. It is anticipated that the PL quenching-based sensing system can be used for the quantitative
                  analysis and high throughput screening of molecules which inhibit the specific biomolecular interactions.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_colloidal_gold_sey05">Efforts to improve the performance of immunoassays and immunosensors by incorporating different kinds of nanostructures have
                  gained considerable momentum over the last decade. Apart from liposomes, which will not be discussed here, most groups focus
                  on artificial, particulate marker systems, both organic and inorganic. The underlying detection procedures may be based either
                  on electro-magnetical or optical techniques. This review will be confined to the latter only, comprising nanoparticle applications
                  generating signals as diverse as static and time-resolved luminescence, one- and two-photon absorption, Raman and Rayleigh
                  scattering as well as surface plasmon resonance and others. In general, all endeavors cited are geared to achieve one or more
                  of the following goals: lowering of detection limits (if possible, down to single-molecule level), parallel integration of
                  multiple signals (multiplexing), signal amplification by several orders of magnitude and prevention of photobleaching effects
                  with concomitant maintenance of antigen binding specificity and sensitivity. Inorganic nanoparticle labels based on noble
                  metals, semiconductor quantum dots and nanoshells appear to be the most versatile systems for these bioanalytical applications

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_colloidal_gold_xux4">It is well known that surface plasmon absorption (color) of Au nanoparticles highly depends on its size, shape, and surrounding
                  surface environment, providing a great opportunity for the development of Au nanoparticles as a probe for chemical and biochemical
                  sensing and as a building block for nano-optical devices. Currently, it remains incompletely understood how the surface properties
                  of Au nanoparticles ultimately define its optical properties, hindering the progress of rational design of Au nanoparticles
                  for biochemical sensing and assembly of nano-optical devices. Ru(bpy)32+ possesses rich photochemical and electrochemical
                  properties, offering a unique probe to study the surface environment of Au nanoparticles. In this study, we investigate the
                  kinetics of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles (6.5, 19, 48, 97 nm) in the presence of Ru(bpy)32+ at 24.0, 33.0,
                  and 51.0 C. We find that the color-change rate of Au nanoparticles is highly sensitive to the amount of Ru(bpy)32+. In addition,
                  the minimum (critical) concentration of Ru(bpy)32+ needed to change the color of Au nanoparticles is highly dependent upon
                  temperature and nanoparticle size. TEM images illustrate that the color-change mechanism of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+
                  highly depends on the size of nanoparticles. Control experiments using NaCl and MgCl2 to replace Ru(bpy)32+ show no color
                  change, suggesting that the color change of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+ is not solely attributable to the salt
                  effect. Other factors, such as adsorption of Ru(bpy)32+ on the Au nanoparticle surface, may be involved. Moreover, in the
                  presence of the critical concentration of Ru(bpy)32+, as temperature increases from 24.0 C to 51.0 C, the color-change rate
                  of 19 nm Au nanoparticles increases 8-fold, whereas the color-change rate of 48 nm Au nanoparticles decreases 3-fold, showing
                  the temperature dependence of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles in the presence of surface adsorbates, Ru(bpy)32+.

                  id="abstract_colloidal_silver_nanoparticles_kam02a">Unique electronic and chemical properties of metal nanoparticles have drawn the attention of chemists, physicists, biologists,
                  and engineers who wish to use them for the development of new generation nanodevices. Metal nanoparticles such as gold and
                  silver show noticeable photoactivity under UV-visible irradiation as is evident from the photoinduced fusion and fragmentation
                  processes. Binding a photoactive molecule (e.g., pyrene) to metal nanoparticle enhances the photochemical activity and renders
                  the organic-inorganic hybrid nanoassemblies suitable for light-harvesting and optoelectronic applications. The nature of charge-transfer
                  interaction of fluorophore with gold surface dictates the pathways with which the excited-state deactivates. Obtaining insight
                  into energy and electron-transfer processes is important to improve the charge separation efficiencies in metal-fluorophore
                  nanoassemblies and photocatalytic activity of metal-semiconductor composites.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_colloids_alv05">In this work, the role of nanoparticle surface charge in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is examined for the common
                  case of measurements made in colloidal solutions of Ag and Au. Average SERS intensities obtained for several analytes (salicylic
                  acid, pyridine, and 2-naphthalenethiol) on Ag and An colloids are correlated with the pH and zeta potential (xi) values of
                  the nanoparticle solutions from which they were recorded. The consequence of the electrostatic interaction between the analyte
                  and the metallic nanoparticle is stressed. The xi potentials of three commonly used colloidal solutions are reported as a
                  function of pH, and a discussion is given on how these influence SERS intensity. Also examined is the importance of nanoparticle
                  aggregation (and colloidal solution collapse) in determining SERS intensities, and how this varies with the pH of the solution.
                  The results show that SERS enhancement is highest at xi potential values where the colloidal nanoparticle solutions are most
                  stable and where the electrostatic repulsion between the particles and the analyte molecules is minimized. These results suggest
                  some important criteria for consideration in all SERS measurements and also provide important insights into the problem of
                  predicting SERS activities for different molecular systems.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_colloids_luk04">We observed a strong, more than 16-fold, enhancement of Texas Red-labeled BSA fluorescence emission when deposited on silver
                  colloid coated surfaces (SCCS). The same labeled protein deposited on silver island films (SIFs) showed an approximate 8-fold
                  fluorescence enhancement. The lifetimes of Texas Red-BSA fluorescence are significantly shorter on silvered surfaces than
                  on uncoated quartz substrate indicating a strong change in radiative decay rate of the dyes. We also observed a 36-fold increased
                  brightness of overlabeled fluorescein-HSA deposited on silver colloid coated surface. Stronger enhancement observed for overlabeled
                  Fl-HSA protein indicates that presence of silver particles partially decreased self-quenching. Our results indicate that surfaces
                  coated with silver colloids are valuable substrates for metal-enhanced fluorescence.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_colloids_sto02">The binding affinity of deoxynucleosides (dA, dG, dC, and dT) to gold nanoparticles was studied using a colorimetric assay
                  to determine if nucleobase sequence may play a role in binding alkanethiol-capped oligonucleotides to gold nanoparticles.
                  These data indicate that the deoxynucleoside dT has a much lower binding affinity to the gold nanoparticle surface than the
                  deoxynucleosides dG, dC, and dA. These data can be correlated with a previous study in our lab which indicated that alkanethiol-capped
                  oligonucleotides containing (dT)20 spacers have a significantly higher surface coverage than oligonucleotides containing (dA)20
                  spacers. To probe the physical consequences of this phenomenon, gold nanoparticles were loaded with alkanethiol-capped poly
                  dT, dA, and dC oligonucleotide sequences of 5-20 bases in length, and the stabilities of the particles in electrolytic media
                  were measured by monitoring a colorimetric change associated with particle agglomeration. The gold nanoparticles loaded with
                  alkanethiol-capped poly dT oligonucleotides exhibited a dramatic increase in stability as the oligonucleotide length was increased
                  from 5 to 20 bases. By comparison, gold nanoparticles loaded with poly dC and poly dA sequences exhibited only a slight increase
                  in stability as the oligonucleotide length was increased. The sequence-dependent stability observed for the DNA-modified gold
                  nanoparticles is attributed to the weaker interaction of the deoxynucleoside dT with the gold nanoparticle surface which results
                  in higher surface coverages and consequently enhanced stability as the oligonucleotide length is increased.

                  id="abstract_colorimetric_detection_asl04a">Biotinylated gold nanoparticles were prepared by using a two-step surface modification procedure. First, a carboxyl-terminated
                  alkanethiol was chemisorbed onto the surface of gold nanoparticles in the presence of a stabilizing agent. Subsequently, the
                  carboxyl groups were reacted with (+)-biotinyl-3,6,9,-trioxaundecanediamine and 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol. This procedure resulted
                  in stable, ligand-modified gold nanoparticles. Upon interaction with streptavidin, the biotinylated gold nanoparticles aggregated
                  by means of specific biomolecular recognition. Their aggregation was studied by optical absorption spectroscopy. Controlled
                  aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles resulted in a shift in the surface plasmon resonance peak and broadening of
                  the absorption spectrum of the nanoparticles. The spectral changes were used to assess the extent of aggregation. Aggregation
                  was found to be dependent on the concentrations of streptavidin, biotinylated gold nanoparticles, and the surface mole fraction
                  of biotin groups on the nanoparticles. Maximum aggregation was observed when 24 nM streptavidin and 0.80 nM biotinylated gold
                  nanoparticles were used. Reversal of nanoparticle aggregation was accomplished by the addition of soluble biotin to the streptavidin-nanoparticle
                  aggregates. Kinetic analysis of the absorbance data showed that streptavidin-induced aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles
                  could be interpreted in terms of a Reaction-Limited Colloidal Aggregation (RLCA) model. This indicates that optical absorption
                  spectroscopy can provide a quantitative measurement of the aggregation process.

                  For the functionalization, AuNPs were first stabilized by chemisorption of n-alkanethiols and then capped with the first generation
                  polyamidoamine (G1 PAMAM) dendrimers. By employing a streptavidin-biotin couple as a model system, avidin was quantitatively
                  analyzed as an inhibitor by sensing the change in photoluminescence (PL) quenching of SA-QDs by biotin-AuNPs. The detection
                  limit for avidin was about 10 nM. It is anticipated that the PL quenching-based sensing system can be used for the quantitative
                  analysis and high throughput screening of molecules which inhibit the specific biomolecular interactions.

                  id="abstract_colorimetric_detection_san03">Modifying colloidal gold particles with DNA is a new interesting approach in the development of genetic biosensors. Normally
                  the modification is designed to consist of a covalent gold-sulfur bond mediated by a thiol group on one end of a single-stranded
                  oligonucleotide. Here we investigate to what extent the binding actually consists of only the sulfur bridge or if some other
                  nonspecific binding mechanism is present as well. We report on an electrophoresis study showing high amounts of strong, non-thiol-mediated
                  (nonspecific) binding of both single- and double-stranded DNA to gold nanoparticles. Interestingly, even the double strands,
                  lacking interacting groups from the exposed bases of single-stranded DNA, interact nonspecifically with the gold particles.
                  We suggest the mechanism for this to be ion-induced dipole dispersive interactions, where the negatively charged phosphate
                  groups on the DNA induce dipoles in the highly polarizable gold particles. Moreover, we show that particles with nonspecifically
                  adsorbed DNA can be separated from the specifically modified and unmodified ones by gel electrophoresis.

                  id="abstract_colorimetric_detection_son05">Forster Resonance Energy Transfer has served as a molecular ruler that reports conformational changes and intramolecular distances
                  of single biomolecules(1-4). However, such rulers suffer from low and fluctuating signal intensities, limited observation
                  time due to photobleaching, and an upper distance limit of similar to 10 nm. Noble metal nanoparticles have plasmon resonances
                  in the visible range and do not blink or bleach. They have been employed as alternative probes to overcome the limitations
                  of organic fluorophores(5,6), and the coupling of plasmons in nearby particles has been exploited to detect particle aggregation
                  by a distinct color change in bulk experiments(7-9). Here we demonstrate that plasmon coupling can be used to monitor distances
                  between single pairs of gold and silver nanoparticles. We followed the directed assembly of gold and silver nanoparticle dimers
                  in real time and studied the kinetics of single DNA hybridization events. These 'plasmon rulers' allowed us to continuously
                  monitor separations of up to 70 nm for &gt;3,000 s.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_contact_formation_mar03">Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements were performed to elucidate the fluorescence quenching of oxazine,
                  rhodamine, carbocyanine, and bora-diaza-indacene dyes by amino acids. Among the natural amino acids, tryptophan exhibits the
                  most pronounced quenching efficiency. Especially, the red-absorbing dyes ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine derivative MR
                  121 are strongly quenched almost exclusively by tryptophan due to the formation of weak or nonfluorescent ground-state complexes
                  with association constants, Kass., ranging from 96 to 206 M-1. Rhodamine, fluorescein, and bora-diaza-indacene derivatives
                  that absorb at shorter wavelengths are also quenched substantially by tyrosine residues. The quenching of carbocyanine dyes,
                  such as Cy5, and Alexa 647 by amino acids can be almost neglected. While quenching of ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine
                  derivative MR121 by tryptophan is dominated by static quenching, dynamic quenching is more efficient for the two bora-diaza-indacene
                  dyes Bodipy-FL and Bodipy630/650. Labeling of the dyes to tryptophan, tryptophan-containing peptides, and proteins (streptavidin)
                  demonstrates that knowledge of these fluorescence quenching processes is crucial for the development of fluorescence-based
                  diagnostic assays. Changes in the fluorescence quantum yield of dye-labeled peptides and proteins might be used advantageously
                  for the quantification of proteases and specific binding partners.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_contact_lens_asl05">Gold colloids are well known to display strong plasmon absorption bands due to electron oscillations induced by the incident
                  light. When the colloids are in proximity, the plasmon absorption bands are often perturbed. This has enabled us recently
                  to successfully develop a glucose sensing platform based on the disassociation of dextrancoated gold colloids, cross-linked
                  with Con A, by glucose. However, a much more useful and simpler property of gold colloids, which has been ill explored with
                  regard to sensing, is their ability to efficiently scatter excitation fight. We have found that our nanogold sensing aggregates
                  are indeed efficient light scatters around the nanogold plasmon absorption band. By measuring the ratio of scattered fight
                  intensities at two different arbitrary wavelengths, 560 and 680 nm, glucose concentrations can be readily determined from
                  a few millimolar up to similar to 60 mM, using a simple white light LED and detection system. Further, by measuring the ratio
                  of the scattered intensities, this sensing approach is independent of the total sensing aggregate concentration and the excitation
                  and detection instrumentation fluctuations or drifts. This simplistic and low-cost approach to glucose sensing, coupled with
                  the sensing aggreagates' ability to scatter red light, suggests the potential use of these aggregates for use in physiological
                  transdermal glucose monitoring, either for implantable skin sensors or glucose sensing tattoos (discussed later).

                  by its frequency dependent local dielectric constant. For simple metal shapes (planar infinite surface and spherical particle)
                  a version of the polarizable continuum model based on the integral equation formalism has been used, while an alternative
                  methodology has been implemented to treat metal particles of arbitrary shape. In both cases, equations have been numerically

                  molecule to the metal are evaluated exploiting the linear response theory (TDHF or TDDFT where TD?time dependent). The radiative
                  decay rate of the whole system (molecule+metal/solvent) is calculated, still using a continuum model, in terms of the response
                  of the surrounding to the molecular transition. The model presented has been applied to the study of the radiative and nonradiative
                  lifetimes of a lissamine molecule in solution (water) and close to gold spherical nanoparticles of different radius. In addition,
                  the influence of the metal shape has been analyzed by performing calculations on a system composed by a coumarin-type molecule
                  close to silver aggregates of complex shape.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none"
                  id="abstract_correlation_spectroscopy_egg98">The photostability of fluorescent dyes is of crucial importance for the statistical accuracy of single-molecule detection
                  (SMD) and for the image quality of scanning confocal microscopy. Concurrent results for the photostability were obtained by
                  two different experimental techniques. First, the photostabilities of several coumarin and rhodamine derivatives in aqueous
                  solution were obtained by monitoring the steady-state fluorescence decay in a quartz cell. Furthermore, an epi-illuminated
                  microscope, continuous wave (CW) excitation at 514.5 nm, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with a newly developed
                  theory were used to study the photobleaching characteristics of rhodamines under conditions used for SMD. Depending on the
                  rhodamine structure, the probability of photobleaching, pb, is in the order of 10-6-10-7 for irradiances below 103 W/cm2.
                  However, a considerable increase of pb for irradiances above this level was observed which can only be described by photobleaching
                  reactions from higher excited states (two-step photolysis). In view of these observations, the probability of photobleaching,
                  pb, as well as a closed expression of its dependence on the CW excitation irradiance considering a five-level molecular electronic
                  state model with the possibility of photobleaching from higher excited electronic states, is derived. From this model, optimal
                  conditions for SMD with respect to the number of emitted fluorescence photons and to the signal-to-background ratio are discussed,
                  taking into account both saturation and photobleaching. The additional photobleaching due to two-step photolysis limits the
                  applicable irradiance.

                  id="abstract_correlation_spectroscopy_mar03">Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements were performed to elucidate the fluorescence quenching of oxazine,
                  rhodamine, carbocyanine, and bora-diaza-indacene dyes by amino acids. Among the natural amino acids, tryptophan exhibits the
                  most pronounced quenching efficiency. Especially, the red-absorbing dyes ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine derivative MR
                  121 are strongly quenched almost exclusively by tryptophan due to the formation of weak or nonfluorescent ground-state complexes
                  with association constants, Kass., ranging from 96 to 206 M-1. Rhodamine, fluorescein, and bora-diaza-indacene derivatives
                  that absorb at shorter wavelengths are also quenched substantially by tyrosine residues. The quenching of carbocyanine dyes,
                  such as Cy5, and Alexa 647 by amino acids can be almost neglected. While quenching of ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine
                  derivative MR121 by tryptophan is dominated by static quenching, dynamic quenching is more efficient for the two bora-diaza-indacene
                  dyes Bodipy-FL and Bodipy630/650. Labeling of the dyes to tryptophan, tryptophan-containing peptides, and proteins (streptavidin)
                  demonstrates that knowledge of these fluorescence quenching processes is crucial for the development of fluorescence-based
                  diagnostic assays. Changes in the fluorescence quantum yield of dye-labeled peptides and proteins might be used advantageously
                  for the quantification of proteases and specific binding partners.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_crystallites_lea02">The linear absorption cross section is a crucial parameter to the design of nanocrystal quantum dot devices and to the interpretation
                  of spectroscopic data. We measure and report the size-dependent absorption cross section of CdSe nanocrystal quantum dots.
                  We compare the results for absorption far above the band edge, where the quantum dot density of states may be approximated
                  as a continuum, to simple theoretical models of light scattering from light-absorbing small particles. Excellent agreement
                  with theory is found for dilute dispersions in hexane. We find that for absorption at 350 nm the per particle absorption cross
                  section C-abs (in cm(2)) for CdSe is C-abs = (5.501 x 10(5))a(3) cm(-1), where a is the particle radius in cm. The absorption
                  cross section is observed to be largely insensitive to the solvent refractive index. Detailed modeling of the effect of the
                  ligand shell may be necessary to understand the lack of sensitivity of the absorption properties of nanocrystal quantum dots
                  to the refractive index of the medium.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_decay_rup82">The decay of an excited molecule near a small metal sphere is considered from the viewpoint of electromagnetic theory. The
                  total decay rate of the emitting dipole is obtained by considering the two mechanisms through which energy is dissipated.
                  One is the radiative loss, which is calculated from the Poynting vector, and the other is the nonradiative decay which is
                  calculated from the Ohmic losses inside the sphere. Numerical computations are performed for the case of a molecule near a
                  small silver sphere, and the results are compared with those for a molecule near the planar boundary of a silver half-space.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_denaturation_grd02">The secondary structure of bovine serum albumin (BSA) is determined from infrared spectra (cast films, solution in phosphate
                  buffer) by analyzing the structure of Amide bands. Due to strong overlapping of intrinsic bands three classical methods of
                  band decomposition was implemented: Fourier self deconvolution, second derivatives and band fitting algorithm. The initial
                  values for the number of the components and their position was checked with a novel procedure of dry and hydrated H/D exchange.
                  The most dominant band component in Amide I region is the band at 1654 cm-1, which is usually attributed to a-helical structure.
                  Other bands in Amide I region are attributed to various type of turns. Hydration of protein, as well as the solvation of protein
                  in phosphate buffer, induces the radical change in the secondary structure, especially in the population of a-helices. Drying
                  of the protein film causes a partial denaturation. Classical methods for determine the changes in secondary structure are
                  not accurate enough. Moreover, the interpretation of changes can be easily misleading. Hence, the difference spectroscopy
                  was used to clarify the effects of hydration and solvation on the protein secondary structure. The solvated protein was measured
                  in ATR cell. For proper compare the ATR spectrum with the normal transmission one, first optical constant n and k were calculated
                  and later the exact absorption spectrum.

                  a metal particle of complex shape and, possibly, in the presence of a solvent. The molecule is treated quantum mechanically
                  at Hartree?Fock (HF) or density-functional theory (DFT) level. The metal/solvent is considered as a continuous body, characterized
                  by its frequency dependent local dielectric constant. For simple metal shapes (planar infinite surface and spherical particle)
                  a version of the polarizable continuum model based on the integral equation formalism has been used, while an alternative
                  methodology has been implemented to treat metal particles of arbitrary shape. In both cases, equations have been numerically
                  solved using a boundary element method. Excitation energies and nonradiative decay rates due to the energy transfer from the
                  molecule to the metal are evaluated exploiting the linear response theory (TDHF or TDDFT where TD?time dependent). The radiative
                  decay rate of the whole system (molecule+metal/solvent) is calculated, still using a continuum model, in terms of the response
                  of the surrounding to the molecular transition. The model presented has been applied to the study of the radiative and nonradiative
                  lifetimes of a lissamine molecule in solution (water) and close to gold spherical nanoparticles of different radius. In addition,
                  the influence of the metal shape has been analyzed by performing calculations on a system composed by a coumarin-type molecule
                  close to silver aggregates of complex shape.

                  model, the molecule is treated quantum mechanically at the density-functional theory level and its excitations with a time-dependent
                  density-functional theory procedure. The metal is described through its dielectric response properties. The nonlocal features
                  of such a response are taken into account by using a modified Lindhard-Mermin dielectric constant. The presence of small random
                  roughness on the metal surface is described with the model of Rahman and Maradudin [Phys. Rev. B 21, 504 (1980)]. Systems
                  in which the molecule close to the metal is immersed in an homogeneous matrix or deposited on a spacer are considered. The
                  matrix and the spacer are treated with the polarizable continuum model. The molecule-metal and the molecule-matrix (or molecule-spacer)
                  electrostatic interactions are described by using the integral equation formalism, numerically treated with a boundary element
                  method. As a test case, the method has been applied to the study of phosphorescence from biacetyl close to a silver surface
                  and immersed in or deposited on solid ammonia. Our results show that nonlocal metal response and surface roughness have an
                  important role in explaining measured lifetimes.

                  In the absence of direct overlap of molecular orbitals and electronic states in the metal, the main enhancement source is
                  the strong electric field of the surface plasmon resonance in a nanoparticle acting on a molecule near the surface. In small
                  particles, the electromagnetic enhancement is strongly modified by quantum-size effects. We show that, in nanometer-sized
                  particles, SERS magnitude is determined by a competition between several quantum-size effects such as the Landau damping of
                  surface plasmon resonance and reduced screening near the nanoparticle surface. Using time-dependent local density approximation,
                  we calculate spatial distribution of local fields near the surface and enhancement factor for different nanoparticles sizes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_dependence_fan03">Gold nanoparticles quench the fluorescence of cationic polyfluorene with Stern-Volmer constants (KSV) approaching 1011 M-1,
                  several orders of magnitude larger than any previously reported conjugated polymer-quencher pair and 9-10 orders of magnitude
                  larger than small molecule dye-quencher pairs. The dependence of KSV on ionic strength, charge and conjugation length of the
                  polymer, and the dimensions (and thus optical properties) of the nanoparticles suggests that three factors account for this
                  extraordinary efficiency: (i) amplification of the quenching via rapid internal energy or electron transfer, (ii) electrostatic
                  interactions between the cationic polymer and anionic nanoparticles, and (iii) the ability of gold nanoparticles to quench
                  via efficient energy transfer. As a result of this extraordinarily high KSV, quenching can be observed even at subpicomolar
                  concentrations of nanoparticles, suggesting that the combination of conjugated polymers with these nanomaterials can potentially
                  lead to improved sensitivity in optical biosensors.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_dependence_gra95">The design and initial characterization of two-dimensional arrays of colloidal Au particles are reported. These surfaces are
                  prepared by self-assembly of 12 nn diameter colloidal Au particles onto immobilized polymers having pendant functional groups
                  with high affinity for Au (i.e., CN, SH, and NH2). The polymers are formed by condensation of functionalized alkoxysilanes
                  onto cleaned quartz, glass, and SiO2 surfaces. The assembly protocol is carried out completely in solution: cleaned substrates
                  are immersed in methanolic solutions of organosilane, rinsed, and subsequently immersed in aqueous colloidal Au solutions.
                  Two-dimensional arrays spontaneously form on the polymer surface, The resulting substrates have been characterized by UV-vis
                  spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). TEM data show that the
                  particles are spatially separated but close enough to interact electromagnetically (small spacing compared to lambda). The
                  UV-vis data show that collective particle surface plasmon modes are present in the 650-750 nm region, suggesting that these
                  assemblies are SERS-active. This is indeed the case, with enhancement factors of roughly 10(4). Au colloid monolayers possess
                  a set of features that make them very attractive for both basic and applied uses, including uniform roughness, high stability,
                  and biocompatibility.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_dielectric_function_for81">The electromagnetic effects on a molecule near a metal surface are considered with the view to understanding the surface-enhanced-Raman-scattering
                  (SERS) effect. The image enhancement effect is calculated including the nonlocal response of the metal and finite molecular
                  size. The effect is much reduced (Ã 10^?5) from that for a point molecule above a local metal but can still give a gain ?
                  10^3. The power emitted by a dipole above a smooth surface is also calculated. For an Ag surface the power emitted in the
                  form of photons, surface plasmons, and electron-hole excitations are found to be in the ratio 1 : 3 : 10^6. The numerical
                  results are calculated using the semi-classical infinite-barrier model of the metal surface with a Lindhard dielectric function
                  modified to take into account finite electron lifetime and core polarization.

                  that causes enhanced relaxation due to surface plasmon excitation and Landau damping. To describe these phenomena, we developed
                  analytical theory based on local random-phase approximation. For the system considered, conventional theory based on metal
                  as continuous dielectric fails both qualitatively and quantitatively. Applications of the present theory and related phenomena

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_dielectric_materials_liv85">In this work we shall develop a formalism which extends previous calculations of lifetimes of excited molecular states near
                  planar dielectric surfaces and near single small dielectric particles to situations where the molecule is adsorbed on a cluster
                  made of several dielectric spherical grains. The nonradiative relaxation rate is seen to be relatively weakly dependent on
                  the cluster structure and, if the molecule is adsorbed on one of the grains, is well approximated by the single grain result.
                  The radiative decay rate and hence the quantum yield are much more sensitive to the geometry of the cluster which determines
                  the position (in frequency) of the dielectric resonances of the cluster. The formalism developed here may be used to evaluate
                  local field intensities at different positions within a cluster of dielectric grains under the influence of an external incident
                  field. The Journal of Chemical Physics is copyrighted by The American Institute of Physics.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_diffraction_gratings_bla04">The spontaneous emission of an excited atom surrounded by different materials is studied in the framework of a semiclassical
                  approach, where the transition dipole moment acts as the source of the emission field. The emission in the presence of semiinfinite
                  media, metallic nanorings, spheres, gratings, and other complex geometries is investigated. Strong emission enhancement effects
                  are obtained in some of these geometries associated to the excitation of plasmons (e.g., in nanorings or spheres). Furthermore,
                  the emission is shown to take place only along narrow angular distributions when the atom is located inside a low-index dielectric
                  and near its planar surface, or when metallic nanogratings are employed at certain resonant wave lengths. In particular, axially
                  symmetric gratings made of real silver metal are considered, and both emission rate enhancement and focused far-field emission
                  are achieved simultaneously when the grating is decorated with further nanostructures.

                  of the excitation point-spread function of point-like fluorescent probes is reviewed. It is shown that molecular distances
                  can be measured with accuracy better than 10 nm using conventional far-field optics. A detailed account of the methodology,
                  theoretical considerations, signal processing, and data fitting algorithms is given.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_diffusion_egg98">The photostability of fluorescent dyes is of crucial importance for the statistical accuracy of single-molecule detection
                  (SMD) and for the image quality of scanning confocal microscopy. Concurrent results for the photostability were obtained by
                  two different experimental techniques. First, the photostabilities of several coumarin and rhodamine derivatives in aqueous
                  solution were obtained by monitoring the steady-state fluorescence decay in a quartz cell. Furthermore, an epi-illuminated
                  microscope, continuous wave (CW) excitation at 514.5 nm, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with a newly developed
                  theory were used to study the photobleaching characteristics of rhodamines under conditions used for SMD. Depending on the
                  rhodamine structure, the probability of photobleaching, pb, is in the order of 10-6-10-7 for irradiances below 103 W/cm2.
                  However, a considerable increase of pb for irradiances above this level was observed which can only be described by photobleaching

                  pb, as well as a closed expression of its dependence on the CW excitation irradiance considering a five-level molecular electronic
                  state model with the possibility of photobleaching from higher excited electronic states, is derived. From this model, optimal
                  conditions for SMD with respect to the number of emitted fluorescence photons and to the signal-to-background ratio are discussed,
                  taking into account both saturation and photobleaching. The additional photobleaching due to two-step photolysis limits the
                  applicable irradiance.

                  id="abstract_dip_pen_nanolithography_kam02a">Unique electronic and chemical properties of metal nanoparticles have drawn the attention of chemists, physicists, biologists,
                  and engineers who wish to use them for the development of new generation nanodevices. Metal nanoparticles such as gold and
                  silver show noticeable photoactivity under UV-visible irradiation as is evident from the photoinduced fusion and fragmentation
                  processes. Binding a photoactive molecule (e.g., pyrene) to metal nanoparticle enhances the photochemical activity and renders
                  the organic-inorganic hybrid nanoassemblies suitable for light-harvesting and optoelectronic applications. The nature of charge-transfer
                  interaction of fluorophore with gold surface dictates the pathways with which the excited-state deactivates. Obtaining insight
                  into energy and electron-transfer processes is important to improve the charge separation efficiencies in metal-fluorophore
                  nanoassemblies and photocatalytic activity of metal-semiconductor composites.

                  id="abstract_dip_pen_nanolithography_lij05">In this paper, we had proposed a silicon integrated circuit (IC) compatible DNA-detection platform using photodiode and ordinary
                  optical illumination to detect DNA hybridization events occurred on the chip surface. The method utilizes gold nanoparticle
                  labeling and silver enhancement to generate opaque surface at area with target DNA hybridization. A photodiode fabricated
                  underneath the supporting surface can then be used to detect the light intensity changes, before and after the silver enhancement.
                  With this technique, we have successfully discriminated single base-mismatched DNA from matched DNA sequence, and the detection
                  limit could be as low as 10 pM. By exploiting the advanced modern IC manufacturing technology and the well-established electrochemical
                  immobilization of DNA, this approach has the potential to be used to construct a portable high-density DNA nanoarray system
                  with fully electronic readout. &amp;COPY; 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

                  id="abstract_discrete_dipole_approximation_kel03">The optical properties of metal nanoparticles have long been of interest in physical chemistry, starting with Faraday's investigations
                  of colloidal gold in the middle 1800s. More recently, new lithographic techniques as well as improvements to classical wet
                  chemistry methods have made it possible to synthesize noble metal nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes, shapes, and dielectric
                  environments. In this feature article, we describe recent progress in the theory of nanoparticle optical properties, particularly
                  methods for solving Maxwell's equations for light scattering from particles of arbitrary shape in a complex environment. Included
                  is a description of the qualitative features of dipole and quadrupole plasmon resonances for spherical particles; a discussion
                  of analytical and numerical methods for calculating extinction and scattering cross-sections, local fields, and other optical
                  properties for nonspherical particles; and a survey of applications to problems of recent interest involving triangular silver

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_discrimination_kne00">A method has been developed for highly sensitive detection of specific DNA sequences in a homogeneous assay using labeled
                  oligonucleotide molecules in combination with single-molecule photon burst counting and identification. The fluorescently
                  labeled oligonucleotides are called smart probes because they report the presence of complementary target sequences by a strong
                  increase in fluorescence intensity. The smart probes consist of a fluorescent dye attached at the terminus of a hairpin oligonucleotide.
                  The presented technique takes advantage of the fact that the used oxazine dye JA242 is efficiently quenched by complementary
                  guanosine residues. Upon specific hybridization to the target DNA, the smart probe undergoes a conformational change that
                  forces the fluorescent dye and the guanosine residues apart, thereby increasing the fluorescence intensity about six fold
                  in ensemble measurements. To increase the detection sensitivity below the nanomolar range, a confocal fluorescence microscope
                  was used to observe the fluorescence bursts from individual smart probes in the presence and absence of target DNA as they
                  passed through the focused laser beam. Smart probes were excited by a pulsed diode laser emitting at 635 nm with a repetition
                  rate of 64 MHz. Each fluorescence burst was identified by three independent parameters: (a) the burst size, (b) the burst
                  duration, and (c) the fluorescence lifetime. Through the use of this multiparameter analysis, higher discrimination accuracies
                  between smart probes and hybridized probe-target duplexes were achieved. The presented multiparameter detection technique
                  permits the identification of picomolar target DNA concentrations in a homogeneous assay, i.e., the detection of specific
                  DNA sequences in a 200-fold excess of labeled probe molecules.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_dna_hei05">We demonstrate that commercially available unmodified carbocyanine dyes such as Cy5 (usually excited at 633 nm) can be used
                  as efficient reversible single-molecule optical switch, whose fluorescent state after apparent photobleaching can be restored
                  at room temperature upon irradiation at shorter wavelengths. Ensemble photobleaching and recovery experiments of Cy5 in aqueous
                  solution irradiating first at 633 nm, then at 337, 488, or 532 nm, demonstrate that restoration of absorption and fluorescence
                  strongly depends on efficient oxygen removal and the addition of the triplet quencher -mercaptoethylamine. Single-molecule
                  fluorescence experiments show that individual immobilized Cy5 molecules can be switched optically in milliseconds by applying
                  alternating excitation at 633 and 488 nm between a fluorescent and nonfluorescent state up to 100 times with a reliability
                  of &gt;90% at room temperature. Because of their intriguing performance, carbocyanine dyes volunteer as a simple alternative
                  for ultrahigh-density optical data storage. Measurements on single donor/acceptor (tetramethylrhodamine/Cy5) labeled oligonucleotides
                  point out that the described light-driven switching behavior imposes fundamental limitations on the use of carbocyanine dyes
                  as energy transfer acceptors for the study of biological processes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_dna_mar03">Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements were performed to elucidate the fluorescence quenching of oxazine,
                  rhodamine, carbocyanine, and bora-diaza-indacene dyes by amino acids. Among the natural amino acids, tryptophan exhibits the
                  most pronounced quenching efficiency. Especially, the red-absorbing dyes ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine derivative MR
                  121 are strongly quenched almost exclusively by tryptophan due to the formation of weak or nonfluorescent ground-state complexes
                  with association constants, Kass., ranging from 96 to 206 M-1. Rhodamine, fluorescein, and bora-diaza-indacene derivatives
                  that absorb at shorter wavelengths are also quenched substantially by tyrosine residues. The quenching of carbocyanine dyes,
                  such as Cy5, and Alexa 647 by amino acids can be almost neglected. While quenching of ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine
                  derivative MR121 by tryptophan is dominated by static quenching, dynamic quenching is more efficient for the two bora-diaza-indacene
                  dyes Bodipy-FL and Bodipy630/650. Labeling of the dyes to tryptophan, tryptophan-containing peptides, and proteins (streptavidin)
                  demonstrates that knowledge of these fluorescence quenching processes is crucial for the development of fluorescence-based
                  diagnostic assays. Changes in the fluorescence quantum yield of dye-labeled peptides and proteins might be used advantageously
                  for the quantification of proteases and specific binding partners.

                  nanoparticles in N,N-dimethylformamide. The formation of particle aggregates was observed upon mixing the particle solution
                  with the complex solution, in which the complexes behaved like linker molecules. Luminescent intensity of the complexes was
                  enhanced in the presence of silver nanoparticles, but at only a limited particle concentration region. The observed particle
                  concentration dependences of the luminescent intensity were regarded as the result of a delicate balance between an enhancing
                  and a quenching effect of the silver nanoparticles. In addition to the change in intensity, silver nanoparticles also affected
                  the asymmetric ratio (or monochromaticity) of the europium luminescence. These changes in the luminescent properties of the
                  complex were discussed in terms of the effects of particle aggregates and consequent modifications of the local electromagnetic

                  a target polynucleotide is described. In this new nanoparticle-based detection system, Au particles (Â 13 nm diameter), which
                  are capped with 3'- and 5'-(alkanethiol)oligonucleotides, are used to complex a 24-base polynucleotide target. Hybridization
                  of the target with the probes results in the formation of an extended polymeric Au nanoparticle/polynucleotide aggregate,
                  which triggers a red to purple color change in solution. The color change is due to a red shift in the surface plasmon resonance
                  of the Au nanoparticles. The aggregates exhibit characteristic, exceptionally sharp "melting transitions" (monitored at 260
                  or 700 nm), which allows one to distinguish target sequences that contain one base end mismatches, deletions, or an insertion
                  from the fully complementary target. When test solutions are spotted onto a C18 reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography plate,
                  color differentiation is enhanced and a permanent record of the test is obtained, thereby providing a better method for distinguishing
                  the aforementioned target sequences. Significantly, one-pot colorimetric detection of the target in the presence of four strands
                  with single base imperfections can be accomplished with this new probe system

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_dna_xux4">It is well known that surface plasmon absorption (color) of Au nanoparticles highly depends on its size, shape, and surrounding
                  surface environment, providing a great opportunity for the development of Au nanoparticles as a probe for chemical and biochemical
                  sensing and as a building block for nano-optical devices. Currently, it remains incompletely understood how the surface properties
                  of Au nanoparticles ultimately define its optical properties, hindering the progress of rational design of Au nanoparticles
                  for biochemical sensing and assembly of nano-optical devices. Ru(bpy)32+ possesses rich photochemical and electrochemical
                  properties, offering a unique probe to study the surface environment of Au nanoparticles. In this study, we investigate the
                  kinetics of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles (6.5, 19, 48, 97 nm) in the presence of Ru(bpy)32+ at 24.0, 33.0,
                  and 51.0 C. We find that the color-change rate of Au nanoparticles is highly sensitive to the amount of Ru(bpy)32+. In addition,
                  the minimum (critical) concentration of Ru(bpy)32+ needed to change the color of Au nanoparticles is highly dependent upon
                  temperature and nanoparticle size. TEM images illustrate that the color-change mechanism of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+
                  highly depends on the size of nanoparticles. Control experiments using NaCl and MgCl2 to replace Ru(bpy)32+ show no color
                  change, suggesting that the color change of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+ is not solely attributable to the salt
                  effect. Other factors, such as adsorption of Ru(bpy)32+ on the Au nanoparticle surface, may be involved. Moreover, in the
                  presence of the critical concentration of Ru(bpy)32+, as temperature increases from 24.0 C to 51.0 C, the color-change rate
                  of 19 nm Au nanoparticles increases 8-fold, whereas the color-change rate of 48 nm Au nanoparticles decreases 3-fold, showing
                  the temperature dependence of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles in the presence of surface adsorbates, Ru(bpy)32+.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_dna_hybridization_son05">Forster Resonance Energy Transfer has served as a molecular ruler that reports conformational changes and intramolecular distances
                  of single biomolecules(1-4). However, such rulers suffer from low and fluctuating signal intensities, limited observation
                  time due to photobleaching, and an upper distance limit of similar to 10 nm. Noble metal nanoparticles have plasmon resonances
                  in the visible range and do not blink or bleach. They have been employed as alternative probes to overcome the limitations
                  of organic fluorophores(5,6), and the coupling of plasmons in nearby particles has been exploited to detect particle aggregation
                  by a distinct color change in bulk experiments(7-9). Here we demonstrate that plasmon coupling can be used to monitor distances
                  between single pairs of gold and silver nanoparticles. We followed the directed assembly of gold and silver nanoparticle dimers
                  in real time and studied the kinetics of single DNA hybridization events. These 'plasmon rulers' allowed us to continuously
                  monitor separations of up to 70 nm for &gt;3,000 s.

                  For the functionalization, AuNPs were first stabilized by chemisorption of n-alkanethiols and then capped with the first generation

                  analyzed as an inhibitor by sensing the change in photoluminescence (PL) quenching of SA-QDs by biotin-AuNPs. The detection
                  limit for avidin was about 10 nM. It is anticipated that the PL quenching-based sensing system can be used for the quantitative

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_dye_kne00">A method has been developed for highly sensitive detection of specific DNA sequences in a homogeneous assay using labeled
                  oligonucleotide molecules in combination with single-molecule photon burst counting and identification. The fluorescently
                  labeled oligonucleotides are called smart probes because they report the presence of complementary target sequences by a strong
                  increase in fluorescence intensity. The smart probes consist of a fluorescent dye attached at the terminus of a hairpin oligonucleotide.
                  The presented technique takes advantage of the fact that the used oxazine dye JA242 is efficiently quenched by complementary
                  guanosine residues. Upon specific hybridization to the target DNA, the smart probe undergoes a conformational change that
                  forces the fluorescent dye and the guanosine residues apart, thereby increasing the fluorescence intensity about six fold
                  in ensemble measurements. To increase the detection sensitivity below the nanomolar range, a confocal fluorescence microscope
                  was used to observe the fluorescence bursts from individual smart probes in the presence and absence of target DNA as they
                  passed through the focused laser beam. Smart probes were excited by a pulsed diode laser emitting at 635 nm with a repetition
                  rate of 64 MHz. Each fluorescence burst was identified by three independent parameters: (a) the burst size, (b) the burst
                  duration, and (c) the fluorescence lifetime. Through the use of this multiparameter analysis, higher discrimination accuracies
                  between smart probes and hybridized probe-target duplexes were achieved. The presented multiparameter detection technique
                  permits the identification of picomolar target DNA concentrations in a homogeneous assay, i.e., the detection of specific
                  DNA sequences in a 200-fold excess of labeled probe molecules.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_dyes_dul02">The radiative and nonradiative decay rates of lissamine dye molecules, chemically attached to differently sized gold nanoparticles,
                  are investigated by means of time-resolved fluorescence experiments. A pronounced fluorescence quenching is observed already
                  for the smallest nanoparticles of 1 nm radius. The quenching is caused not only by an increased nonradiative rate but, equally
                  important, by a drastic decrease in the dye's radiative rate. Assuming resonant energy transfer to be responsible for the
                  nonradiative decay channel, we compare our experimental findings with theoretical results derived from the Gersten-Nitzan
                  model.

                  with emission/excitation spectra similar to those of AMCA, Lucifer Yellow, fluorescein, rhodamine 6G, tetramethylrhodamine
                  or Cy3, lissamine rhodamine B, and Texas Red, respectively (the numbers in the Alexa names indicate the approximate excitation
                  wavelength maximum in nm). All Alexa dyes and their conjugates are more fluorescent and more photostable than their commonly
                  used spectral analogues listed above. In addition, Alexa dyes are insensitive to pH in the 4-10 range. We evaluated Alexa
                  dyes compared with conventional dyes in applications using various conjugates, including those of goat anti-mouse IgG (GAM),
                  streptavidin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and concanavalin A (ConA). Conjugates of Alexa 546 are at least twofold more fluo-rescent
                  than Cy3 conjugates. Proteins labeled with the Alexa 568 or Alexa 594 dyes are several-fold brighter than the same proteins

                  high specificity. Hydrazide forms of the Alexa dyes are very bright, formaldehyde-fixable polar tracers. Conjugates of the
                  Alexa 430 (ex 430 nm/em 520 nm) and Alexa 532 (ex 530 nm/em 548 nm) fluorochromes are spectrally unique fluorescent probes,

                  By using quantum dots (QDs) emitting at different wavelengths, the measurement of the distance between these point light sources,
                  which are closer than the optical resolution of 200 nm, was achieved. The nanocrystals have major advantages over conventional
                  chromophores in higher quantum yield, more photostability, and the possibility of different emission wavelengths by an excitation
                  with a single wavelength. The colocalization of two single QDs at the least distance of 40 nm can be measured with a standard
                  deviation of 5 nm and a time resolution of 117 ms using one excitation wavelength.

                  (Os(bpy)(3)(2+)) as phosphorescent labels for the quantification of surface binding of molecules to gold and silver nanoparticles.
                  The fraction of Rtt(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) that is in solution can be distinguished from the surface-bound fraction
                  by the relative lifetimes and integrated emission yields as determined by time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) spectroscopy.
                  Complementary steady-state measurements were carried out to confirm surface attachment of the phosphorescent label molecules.
                  Although the emission of solutions of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) is quenched proportional to the concentration of 10
                  nm Au or 20 nm Ag nanoparticles, the quenching is static and not diffusional quenching observed in Stern-Volmer plots. The
                  results demonstrate that time-resolved spectroscopy provides a rapid method for the measurement of surface binding of labeled
                  molecules on metallic nanoparticles. While steady-state measurements require the preparation of a series of samples with varying
                  quencher concentrations and a reference, the method described herein requires a single sample plus reference. The mechanism
                  for phosphorescence quenching on Au and Ag nanoparticles is discussed in terms of energy and electron transfer theories.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_dynamics_hei05">We demonstrate that commercially available unmodified carbocyanine dyes such as Cy5 (usually excited at 633 nm) can be used
                  as efficient reversible single-molecule optical switch, whose fluorescent state after apparent photobleaching can be restored
                  at room temperature upon irradiation at shorter wavelengths. Ensemble photobleaching and recovery experiments of Cy5 in aqueous
                  solution irradiating first at 633 nm, then at 337, 488, or 532 nm, demonstrate that restoration of absorption and fluorescence
                  strongly depends on efficient oxygen removal and the addition of the triplet quencher -mercaptoethylamine. Single-molecule
                  fluorescence experiments show that individual immobilized Cy5 molecules can be switched optically in milliseconds by applying
                  alternating excitation at 633 and 488 nm between a fluorescent and nonfluorescent state up to 100 times with a reliability
                  of &gt;90% at room temperature. Because of their intriguing performance, carbocyanine dyes volunteer as a simple alternative
                  for ultrahigh-density optical data storage. Measurements on single donor/acceptor (tetramethylrhodamine/Cy5) labeled oligonucleotides
                  point out that the described light-driven switching behavior imposes fundamental limitations on the use of carbocyanine dyes
                  as energy transfer acceptors for the study of biological processes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_dynamics_yos04">As optical trapping by a focused laser beam is applied for nanoparticles, multiple particles are grasped in the focal spot
                  and make an assembly. Gold nanoparticles confined in such a submicrometer optical cage show a characteristic extinction spectrum
                  depending on laser power. The spectral change can be induced reversibly and repeatedly by tuning the laser power, demonstrating
                  that the assembly of gold nanoparticles can be controlled by the gradient force. This is attributed to the soft confinement
                  of nanoparticles dressed in electrostatic potential barriers.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_electric_moments_bla04">The spontaneous emission of an excited atom surrounded by different materials is studied in the framework of a semiclassical
                  approach, where the transition dipole moment acts as the source of the emission field. The emission in the presence of semiinfinite
                  media, metallic nanorings, spheres, gratings, and other complex geometries is investigated. Strong emission enhancement effects
                  are obtained in some of these geometries associated to the excitation of plasmons (e.g., in nanorings or spheres). Furthermore,
                  the emission is shown to take place only along narrow angular distributions when the atom is located inside a low-index dielectric
                  and near its planar surface, or when metallic nanogratings are employed at certain resonant wave lengths. In particular, axially
                  symmetric gratings made of real silver metal are considered, and both emission rate enhancement and focused far-field emission
                  are achieved simultaneously when the grating is decorated with further nanostructures.

                  optical illumination to detect DNA hybridization events occurred on the chip surface. The method utilizes gold nanoparticle
                  labeling and silver enhancement to generate opaque surface at area with target DNA hybridization. A photodiode fabricated
                  underneath the supporting surface can then be used to detect the light intensity changes, before and after the silver enhancement.
                  With this technique, we have successfully discriminated single base-mismatched DNA from matched DNA sequence, and the detection
                  limit could be as low as 10 pM. By exploiting the advanced modern IC manufacturing technology and the well-established electrochemical
                  immobilization of DNA, this approach has the potential to be used to construct a portable high-density DNA nanoarray system

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_electrodynamics_rup82">The decay of an excited molecule near a small metal sphere is considered from the viewpoint of electromagnetic theory. The
                  total decay rate of the emitting dipole is obtained by considering the two mechanisms through which energy is dissipated.
                  One is the radiative loss, which is calculated from the Poynting vector, and the other is the nonradiative decay which is
                  calculated from the Ohmic losses inside the sphere. Numerical computations are performed for the case of a molecule near a
                  small silver sphere, and the results are compared with those for a molecule near the planar boundary of a silver half-space.

                  of colloidal gold in the middle 1800s. More recently, new lithographic techniques as well as improvements to classical wet
                  chemistry methods have made it possible to synthesize noble metal nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes, shapes, and dielectric
                  environments. In this feature article, we describe recent progress in the theory of nanoparticle optical properties, particularly
                  methods for solving Maxwell's equations for light scattering from particles of arbitrary shape in a complex environment. Included
                  is a description of the qualitative features of dipole and quadrupole plasmon resonances for spherical particles; a discussion
                  of analytical and numerical methods for calculating extinction and scattering cross-sections, local fields, and other optical

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_electron_dynamics_xux4">It is well known that surface plasmon absorption (color) of Au nanoparticles highly depends on its size, shape, and surrounding
                  surface environment, providing a great opportunity for the development of Au nanoparticles as a probe for chemical and biochemical
                  sensing and as a building block for nano-optical devices. Currently, it remains incompletely understood how the surface properties
                  of Au nanoparticles ultimately define its optical properties, hindering the progress of rational design of Au nanoparticles
                  for biochemical sensing and assembly of nano-optical devices. Ru(bpy)32+ possesses rich photochemical and electrochemical
                  properties, offering a unique probe to study the surface environment of Au nanoparticles. In this study, we investigate the
                  kinetics of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles (6.5, 19, 48, 97 nm) in the presence of Ru(bpy)32+ at 24.0, 33.0,
                  and 51.0 C. We find that the color-change rate of Au nanoparticles is highly sensitive to the amount of Ru(bpy)32+. In addition,
                  the minimum (critical) concentration of Ru(bpy)32+ needed to change the color of Au nanoparticles is highly dependent upon
                  temperature and nanoparticle size. TEM images illustrate that the color-change mechanism of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+
                  highly depends on the size of nanoparticles. Control experiments using NaCl and MgCl2 to replace Ru(bpy)32+ show no color
                  change, suggesting that the color change of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+ is not solely attributable to the salt
                  effect. Other factors, such as adsorption of Ru(bpy)32+ on the Au nanoparticle surface, may be involved. Moreover, in the
                  presence of the critical concentration of Ru(bpy)32+, as temperature increases from 24.0 C to 51.0 C, the color-change rate
                  of 19 nm Au nanoparticles increases 8-fold, whereas the color-change rate of 48 nm Au nanoparticles decreases 3-fold, showing
                  the temperature dependence of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles in the presence of surface adsorbates, Ru(bpy)32+.

                  labeling density, better sensitivity, and greater penetration into tissues. Gold clusters, such as the 1.4-nm Nanogold, are
                  gold compounds that can be covalently linked to Fab' antibody fragments, making small and stable probes. Silver enhancement
                  then makes these small gold particles easily visible by EM, LM, and directly by eye. Another advance is the combination of
                  fluorescent and gold probes for correlative microscopy. Chemical crosslinking of gold particles to many biologically active
                  molecules has made possible many novel probes, such as gold?lipids, gold?Ni?NTA, and gold?ATP.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_electron_microscopy_pow97">Immunoprobes that combine a fluorescent label with a 1.4-nm gold cluster compound have been prepared by covalent conjugation
                  with polyclonal antibody Fab' fragments. These new immunoconjugates allow the collection of two complementary sets of data,
                  from fluorescence and electron microscopy, from a single labeling experiment. We find that incorporation of one or more fluorescein
                  moieties into the coordinated ligands of the 1.4-nm Nanogold gold cluster label yields a stable, dual-function immunolabel
                  in which fluorescence quenching is negligible. In a second synthetic strategy, Nanogold and fluorescein were separately covalently
                  conjugated to Fab' fragments to yield a probe with very similar properties. With the use of Fab' fragments, the entire probe
                  is smaller than a whole IgG molecule, and it exhibited excellent penetration properties. It was used to localize the pre-mRNA
                  splicing factor SC35 in the HeLa cell nucleus by both fluorescence and electron microscopy.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_electron_microscopy_pow98">Immunoprobes which incorporate both a fluorescent label and a 1.4 nm gold cluster compound were prepared by covalent conjugation
                  to Fab antibody fragments of the Nanogold cluster label followed by a fluorescent moiety. These new immunoconjugates allow
                  the collection of two complementary sets of data, from fluorescence and electron microscopy, from a single labeling experiment.
                  By using Fab fragments, the entire probe is smaller than a whole IgG molecule. A simple fluorescence assay was used to investigate
                  the fluorescence properties of the new probes. They were used to localize the pre-mRNA splicing factor SC35 in the HeLa cell
                  nucleus by both fluorescence and electron microscopy, and also for labeling leukocyte microtubules; labeling was imaged using
                  fluorescence microscopy and, after silver enhancement, by a variety of optical methods and by electron microscopy. Combined
                  Nanogold and Texas Red, Cy3, Lissamine Rhodamine B, and AMCA probes were also prepared, and in preliminary experiments show
                  similar properties to the combined fluorescein and gold cluster probes. The fluorescent and gold cluster probes enable a new
                  degree of correlation between fluorescence and electron microscopy, and may also be used to check labeling of specimens before
                  processing for electron microscopy.

                  photons create interband excitons with nonzero electron spin in the first quantum dot. When the quantum-dot pair is properly
                  designed, this excitation can be transferred to the neighboring dot via the Coulomb interaction with conservation or flipping
                  of electron spin. The second dot can radiate circularly polarized photons at smaller energy. Selection rules for spin transfer
                  are determined by the resonant conditions and by the strong spin-orbit interaction in the valence band of nanocrystals. Coulomb-induced
                  energy and spin transfer in pairs and chains of dots can become very efficient under resonant conditions. The electron can
                  preserve its spin orientation even in randomly oriented nanocrystals.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_electron_microscopy_ben05">Membrane topology of receptors plays an important role in shaping transmembrane signalling of cells. Among the methods used
                  for characterizing receptor clusters, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a donor and acceptor fluorophore plays
                  a unique role based on its capability of detecting molecular level (2-10 nm) proximities of receptors in physiological conditions.
                  Recent development of biotechnology has made possible the usage of colloidal gold particles in a large size range for specific
                  labelling of cells for the purposes of electron microscopy. However, by combining metal and fluorophore labelling or cells,
                  the versatility of metal-fluorophore interactions opens the way for new applications by detecting the presence of the metal
                  particles by the methods of fluorescence spectroscopy. An outstanding feature of the metal nanoparticle-fluorophore interaction
                  is that the metal particle can enhance spontaneous emission of the fluorophore in a distance-dependent fashion, in an interaction
                  range esentially determined by the size of the nanoparticle. In our work enhanced fluorescence of rhodamine and cyanine dyes
                  was observed in the vicinity of immunogold nanoparticles on the surface of JY cells in a flow cytometer. The dyes and the
                  immunogold were targetted to the cell surface receptors MHCI, MHCII, transferrin receptor and CD45 by monoclonal antibodies.
                  The fluorescence enhancement was sensitive to the wavelength of the exciting light, the size and amount of surface bound gold
                  beads, as well as the fluorophore-nanoparticle distance. The intensity of 90&amp;DEG; scattering of the incident light beam was
                  enhanced by the immunogold in a concentration and size-dependent fashion. The 90&amp;DEG; light scattering varied with the wavelength
                  of the incident light in a manner characteristic to gold nanoparticles of the applied sizes. A reduction in photobleaching
                  time constant of the cyanine dye was observed in the vicinity of gold particles in a digital imaging microscope. Modulations
                  of 90&amp;DEG; light scattering intensity and photobleaching time constant indicate the role of the local field in the fluorescence
                  enhancement. A mathematical simulation based on the electrodynamic theory of fluorescence enhancement showed a consistency
                  between the measured enhancement values, the inter-epitope distances and the quantum yields. The feasibility of realizing
                  proximity sensors operating at distance ranges larger than that of the conventional Forster transfer is demonstrated on the
                  surface of living cells. Copyright &amp;COPY; 2004 John Wiley&amp; Sons, Ltd.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_electron_transfer_glo05">The present study describes a new application of ruthenium(II) tris(bipyridine) (Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)) and osmium(II) tris(bipyridine)
                  (Os(bpy)(3)(2+)) as phosphorescent labels for the quantification of surface binding of molecules to gold and silver nanoparticles.
                  The fraction of Rtt(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) that is in solution can be distinguished from the surface-bound fraction
                  by the relative lifetimes and integrated emission yields as determined by time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) spectroscopy.
                  Complementary steady-state measurements were carried out to confirm surface attachment of the phosphorescent label molecules.
                  Although the emission of solutions of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) is quenched proportional to the concentration of 10
                  nm Au or 20 nm Ag nanoparticles, the quenching is static and not diffusional quenching observed in Stern-Volmer plots. The
                  results demonstrate that time-resolved spectroscopy provides a rapid method for the measurement of surface binding of labeled
                  molecules on metallic nanoparticles. While steady-state measurements require the preparation of a series of samples with varying
                  quencher concentrations and a reference, the method described herein requires a single sample plus reference. The mechanism
                  for phosphorescence quenching on Au and Ag nanoparticles is discussed in terms of energy and electron transfer theories.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_electron_transfer_kam02a">Unique electronic and chemical properties of metal nanoparticles have drawn the attention of chemists, physicists, biologists,
                  and engineers who wish to use them for the development of new generation nanodevices. Metal nanoparticles such as gold and
                  silver show noticeable photoactivity under UV-visible irradiation as is evident from the photoinduced fusion and fragmentation
                  processes. Binding a photoactive molecule (e.g., pyrene) to metal nanoparticle enhances the photochemical activity and renders
                  the organic-inorganic hybrid nanoassemblies suitable for light-harvesting and optoelectronic applications. The nature of charge-transfer
                  interaction of fluorophore with gold surface dictates the pathways with which the excited-state deactivates. Obtaining insight
                  into energy and electron-transfer processes is important to improve the charge separation efficiencies in metal-fluorophore
                  nanoassemblies and photocatalytic activity of metal-semiconductor composites.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_electron_transfer_kne00">A method has been developed for highly sensitive detection of specific DNA sequences in a homogeneous assay using labeled
                  oligonucleotide molecules in combination with single-molecule photon burst counting and identification. The fluorescently
                  labeled oligonucleotides are called smart probes because they report the presence of complementary target sequences by a strong
                  increase in fluorescence intensity. The smart probes consist of a fluorescent dye attached at the terminus of a hairpin oligonucleotide.
                  The presented technique takes advantage of the fact that the used oxazine dye JA242 is efficiently quenched by complementary
                  guanosine residues. Upon specific hybridization to the target DNA, the smart probe undergoes a conformational change that
                  forces the fluorescent dye and the guanosine residues apart, thereby increasing the fluorescence intensity about six fold
                  in ensemble measurements. To increase the detection sensitivity below the nanomolar range, a confocal fluorescence microscope
                  was used to observe the fluorescence bursts from individual smart probes in the presence and absence of target DNA as they
                  passed through the focused laser beam. Smart probes were excited by a pulsed diode laser emitting at 635 nm with a repetition
                  rate of 64 MHz. Each fluorescence burst was identified by three independent parameters: (a) the burst size, (b) the burst
                  duration, and (c) the fluorescence lifetime. Through the use of this multiparameter analysis, higher discrimination accuracies
                  between smart probes and hybridized probe-target duplexes were achieved. The presented multiparameter detection technique
                  permits the identification of picomolar target DNA concentrations in a homogeneous assay, i.e., the detection of specific
                  DNA sequences in a 200-fold excess of labeled probe molecules.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_electron_transfer_mar03">Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements were performed to elucidate the fluorescence quenching of oxazine,
                  rhodamine, carbocyanine, and bora-diaza-indacene dyes by amino acids. Among the natural amino acids, tryptophan exhibits the
                  most pronounced quenching efficiency. Especially, the red-absorbing dyes ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine derivative MR
                  121 are strongly quenched almost exclusively by tryptophan due to the formation of weak or nonfluorescent ground-state complexes
                  with association constants, Kass., ranging from 96 to 206 M-1. Rhodamine, fluorescein, and bora-diaza-indacene derivatives
                  that absorb at shorter wavelengths are also quenched substantially by tyrosine residues. The quenching of carbocyanine dyes,
                  such as Cy5, and Alexa 647 by amino acids can be almost neglected. While quenching of ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine
                  derivative MR121 by tryptophan is dominated by static quenching, dynamic quenching is more efficient for the two bora-diaza-indacene
                  dyes Bodipy-FL and Bodipy630/650. Labeling of the dyes to tryptophan, tryptophan-containing peptides, and proteins (streptavidin)
                  demonstrates that knowledge of these fluorescence quenching processes is crucial for the development of fluorescence-based
                  diagnostic assays. Changes in the fluorescence quantum yield of dye-labeled peptides and proteins might be used advantageously
                  for the quantification of proteases and specific binding partners.

                  branched DNA trimers and nanoparticle-DNA conjugates results in the synthesis of nanoparticle trimer and tetramer complexes.
                  Multiple tetramer architectures are investigated, utilizing Au-DNA conjugates with varying secondary structural motifs. Hybridization
                  products are analyzed by gel electrophoresis, and discrete bands are observed corresponding to structures with increasing
                  numbers of hybridization events. Samples extracted from each band are analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, and statistics
                  compiled from micrographs are used to compare assembly characteristics for each architecture. Asymmetric structures are also
                  produced in which both 5- and 10-nm Au particles are assembled on branched scaffolds.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_electrophoresis_kne00">A method has been developed for highly sensitive detection of specific DNA sequences in a homogeneous assay using labeled
                  oligonucleotide molecules in combination with single-molecule photon burst counting and identification. The fluorescently
                  labeled oligonucleotides are called smart probes because they report the presence of complementary target sequences by a strong
                  increase in fluorescence intensity. The smart probes consist of a fluorescent dye attached at the terminus of a hairpin oligonucleotide.
                  The presented technique takes advantage of the fact that the used oxazine dye JA242 is efficiently quenched by complementary
                  guanosine residues. Upon specific hybridization to the target DNA, the smart probe undergoes a conformational change that
                  forces the fluorescent dye and the guanosine residues apart, thereby increasing the fluorescence intensity about six fold
                  in ensemble measurements. To increase the detection sensitivity below the nanomolar range, a confocal fluorescence microscope
                  was used to observe the fluorescence bursts from individual smart probes in the presence and absence of target DNA as they
                  passed through the focused laser beam. Smart probes were excited by a pulsed diode laser emitting at 635 nm with a repetition
                  rate of 64 MHz. Each fluorescence burst was identified by three independent parameters: (a) the burst size, (b) the burst
                  duration, and (c) the fluorescence lifetime. Through the use of this multiparameter analysis, higher discrimination accuracies
                  between smart probes and hybridized probe-target duplexes were achieved. The presented multiparameter detection technique
                  permits the identification of picomolar target DNA concentrations in a homogeneous assay, i.e., the detection of specific
                  DNA sequences in a 200-fold excess of labeled probe molecules.

                  nanoparticles exhibits a new emission band with a maximum at 612Â nm. {T}his band does not exist in pure dye of comparable
                  concentration or in a mixture of dye with a solution of single silver nanoparticles. {A} qualitatively similar red-shifted
                  emission band is observed in pure {R}6{G} dye at very high concentration (3.8 or 16.7Â gÂ l$^{\&amp;minus;1}$). {I}n both cases,
                  no changes occur to the shapes of the absorption spectra of the dye. {W}e explain the observed spectral changes in terms of
                  {J}-aggregates of {R}6{G} molecules whose formation is probable in the presence of {A}g aggregates with a complicated surface
                  structure and is much less likely in the case of adsorption of dye molecules on single {A}g nanoparticles. {A}lternatively,
                  many features observed in the experiment can be explained by an enhancement of the rates of spontaneous radiative transitions
                  in the proximity of metallic particles, which is due to a modification of the local density of electromagnetic modes in the
                  vicinity of metal surfaces at energies resonant with surface plasmon resonances.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_energy_transfer_asl04">A fluorescence-based detection scheme that uses ligand functionalized gold nanoparticles is proposed. The transduction scheme
                  is based on the strong quenching of the fluorescence emission exerted by metallic surfaces on fluorophores positioned in their
                  immediate vicinity (&lt;5 nm). Binding of fluorophore-labeled anti-biotin to biotinylated gold nanoparticles resulted in decreasedfluorescence
                  emission intensity. Subsequent competitive dissociation of labeled anti-biotin with D-biotin resulted in increased fluorescence
                  emission intensity. These interactions occurred by means of specific molecular recognition because when the binding sites
                  of anti-biotin were saturated with D-biotin prior to interaction with the gold nanoparticles; changes in the fluorescence
                  emission intensity were not observed.

                  of the diffraction theory for a dipole antenna established by Van del Pol and Bremmer. This theory is somewhat simpler than
                  but formally equivalent to that established by Ruppin and preserves a feature which is closer to the method of the theory
                  established by Chance, Prock, and Silbey for a flat surface. The results, when compared to those obtained from the static
                  image theory, show that this latter theory can be very inaccurate for large molecule-sphere distances or highly conducting
                  spheres, consistent with previous findings for surfaces with perfect flatness or small roughness. The Journal of Chemical

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_energy_transfer_bar05">Excited-state interactions between chlorophyll a (Chla) and gold nanoparticles have been studied. The emission intensity of
                  Chla is quenched by gold nanoparticles. The dominant process for this quenching has been attributed to the process of photoinduced
                  electron transfer from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, although because of a small overlap between fluorescence of Chla
                  and absorption of gold nanoparticles, the energy-transfer process cannot be ruled out. Photoinduced electron-transfer mechanism
                  is supported by the electrochemical modulation of fluorescence of Chla. In absence of an applied bias, Chla cast on gold film,
                  as a result of electron transfer, exhibits a very weak fluorescence. However, upon negatively charging the gold nanocore by
                  external bias, an increase in fluorescence intensity is observed. The negatively charged gold nanoparticles create a barrier
                  and suppress the electron-transfer process from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, resulting in an increase in radiative
                  process. Nanosecond laser flash experiments of Chla in the presence of gold nanoparticles and fullerene (C-60) have demonstrated
                  that Au nanoparticles, besides accepting electrons, can also mediate or shuttle electrons to another acceptor. Taking advantage
                  of these properties of gold nanoparticles, a photoelectrochemical cell based on Chla and gold nanoparticles is constructed.
                  A superior performance of this cell compared to that without the gold film is due to the beneficial role of gold nanoparticles
                  in accepting and shuttling the photogenerated electrons in Chla to the collecting electrode, leading to an enhancement in
                  charge separation efficiency.

                  (Os(bpy)(3)(2+)) as phosphorescent labels for the quantification of surface binding of molecules to gold and silver nanoparticles.
                  The fraction of Rtt(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) that is in solution can be distinguished from the surface-bound fraction
                  by the relative lifetimes and integrated emission yields as determined by time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) spectroscopy.
                  Complementary steady-state measurements were carried out to confirm surface attachment of the phosphorescent label molecules.
                  Although the emission of solutions of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) is quenched proportional to the concentration of 10
                  nm Au or 20 nm Ag nanoparticles, the quenching is static and not diffusional quenching observed in Stern-Volmer plots. The
                  results demonstrate that time-resolved spectroscopy provides a rapid method for the measurement of surface binding of labeled
                  molecules on metallic nanoparticles. While steady-state measurements require the preparation of a series of samples with varying
                  quencher concentrations and a reference, the method described herein requires a single sample plus reference. The mechanism
                  for phosphorescence quenching on Au and Ag nanoparticles is discussed in terms of energy and electron transfer theories.

                  id="abstract_engineering_of_decay_rates_mor05">Fast and numerically stable transfer-matrix solution is presented for the classical electromagnetics problem of a dipole radiating
                  inside and outside a stratified sphere consisting of concentric spherical shells. There is no limitation on the dipole position,
                  the number of the concentric shells, the shell medium, or on the sphere radius. Electromagnetic fields are determined anywhere
                  in the space, the time-averaged angular distribution of the radiated power, the total radiated power, Ohmic losses due to
                  an absorbing shell, and Green?s function are calculated. An absorbing, optically active, and ultrathin (less, approximate10
                  nm) metallic shell (core), characterized by a nonlocal dielectric function, are all allowed. The classical results are then
                  applied to inelastic light scattering (fluorescence and Raman), the radiative and nonradiative normalized decay rates, and
                  frequency shift. Using correspondence principle, the radiative decay rate is calculated from the Poynting vector, whereas
                  the nonradiative decay rate is calculated from the Ohmic losses inside a sphere absorptive shell. Numerical stability of our
                  method and limitations of classical description of decay rates are addressed. The importance of grouping various radiative
                  and nonradiative decay mechanisms into local and nonlocal decay rates is emphasized. Further possible extensions of the theory
                  presented here to the case of an arbitrary multilayered (axially symmetric) particle and to the classical problem of a radiating
                  quadrupole in the presence of a multilayered particle are briefly outlined. Various applications for chemical speciation,
                  LIDAR, fluorescent microscopy, engineering of decay rates, identification of biological particles, and monitoring specific
                  cell functions are envisaged. Computer program is freely available at http://www.wave-scattering.com.

                  and engineers who wish to use them for the development of new generation nanodevices. Metal nanoparticles such as gold and
                  silver show noticeable photoactivity under UV-visible irradiation as is evident from the photoinduced fusion and fragmentation
                  processes. Binding a photoactive molecule (e.g., pyrene) to metal nanoparticle enhances the photochemical activity and renders
                  the organic-inorganic hybrid nanoassemblies suitable for light-harvesting and optoelectronic applications. The nature of charge-transfer
                  interaction of fluorophore with gold surface dictates the pathways with which the excited-state deactivates. Obtaining insight
                  into energy and electron-transfer processes is important to improve the charge separation efficiencies in metal-fluorophore
                  nanoassemblies and photocatalytic activity of metal-semiconductor composites.

                  id="abstract_enhanced_raman_scattering_sey05">Efforts to improve the performance of immunoassays and immunosensors by incorporating different kinds of nanostructures have
                  gained considerable momentum over the last decade. Apart from liposomes, which will not be discussed here, most groups focus
                  on artificial, particulate marker systems, both organic and inorganic. The underlying detection procedures may be based either
                  on electro-magnetical or optical techniques. This review will be confined to the latter only, comprising nanoparticle applications
                  generating signals as diverse as static and time-resolved luminescence, one- and two-photon absorption, Raman and Rayleigh
                  scattering as well as surface plasmon resonance and others. In general, all endeavors cited are geared to achieve one or more
                  of the following goals: lowering of detection limits (if possible, down to single-molecule level), parallel integration of
                  multiple signals (multiplexing), signal amplification by several orders of magnitude and prevention of photobleaching effects
                  with concomitant maintenance of antigen binding specificity and sensitivity. Inorganic nanoparticle labels based on noble
                  metals, semiconductor quantum dots and nanoshells appear to be the most versatile systems for these bioanalytical applications

                  id="abstract_enhanced_raman_scattering_sto02">The binding affinity of deoxynucleosides (dA, dG, dC, and dT) to gold nanoparticles was studied using a colorimetric assay
                  to determine if nucleobase sequence may play a role in binding alkanethiol-capped oligonucleotides to gold nanoparticles.
                  These data indicate that the deoxynucleoside dT has a much lower binding affinity to the gold nanoparticle surface than the
                  deoxynucleosides dG, dC, and dA. These data can be correlated with a previous study in our lab which indicated that alkanethiol-capped
                  oligonucleotides containing (dT)20 spacers have a significantly higher surface coverage than oligonucleotides containing (dA)20
                  spacers. To probe the physical consequences of this phenomenon, gold nanoparticles were loaded with alkanethiol-capped poly
                  dT, dA, and dC oligonucleotide sequences of 5-20 bases in length, and the stabilities of the particles in electrolytic media
                  were measured by monitoring a colorimetric change associated with particle agglomeration. The gold nanoparticles loaded with
                  alkanethiol-capped poly dT oligonucleotides exhibited a dramatic increase in stability as the oligonucleotide length was increased
                  from 5 to 20 bases. By comparison, gold nanoparticles loaded with poly dC and poly dA sequences exhibited only a slight increase
                  in stability as the oligonucleotide length was increased. The sequence-dependent stability observed for the DNA-modified gold
                  nanoparticles is attributed to the weaker interaction of the deoxynucleoside dT with the gold nanoparticle surface which results
                  in higher surface coverages and consequently enhanced stability as the oligonucleotide length is increased.

                  as well as for the double-stranded DNA molecules. Two states are fluorescent, with lifetimes in the range of 0.5-1 ns and

                  id="abstract_exchange_interactions__electron__gov05">The mechanisms of energy and spin transfer in quantum dot pairs coupled via the Coulomb interaction are studied. Exciton transfer
                  can be resonant or phonon-assisted. In both cases, the transfer rates strongly depend on the resonance conditions. The spin
                  selection rules in the transfer process come from the exchange and spin-orbit interactions. The character of energy dissipation
                  in spin transfer is different than that in the traditional spin currents. The spin-dependent photon cross-correlation functions
                  reflect the exciton transfer process. In addition, a mathematical method to calculate FÃ¶rster transfer in crystalline nanostructures
                  beyond the dipole-dipole approximation is described.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_excitation_hei05">We demonstrate that commercially available unmodified carbocyanine dyes such as Cy5 (usually excited at 633 nm) can be used
                  as efficient reversible single-molecule optical switch, whose fluorescent state after apparent photobleaching can be restored
                  at room temperature upon irradiation at shorter wavelengths. Ensemble photobleaching and recovery experiments of Cy5 in aqueous
                  solution irradiating first at 633 nm, then at 337, 488, or 532 nm, demonstrate that restoration of absorption and fluorescence
                  strongly depends on efficient oxygen removal and the addition of the triplet quencher -mercaptoethylamine. Single-molecule
                  fluorescence experiments show that individual immobilized Cy5 molecules can be switched optically in milliseconds by applying
                  alternating excitation at 633 and 488 nm between a fluorescent and nonfluorescent state up to 100 times with a reliability
                  of &gt;90% at room temperature. Because of their intriguing performance, carbocyanine dyes volunteer as a simple alternative
                  for ultrahigh-density optical data storage. Measurements on single donor/acceptor (tetramethylrhodamine/Cy5) labeled oligonucleotides
                  point out that the described light-driven switching behavior imposes fundamental limitations on the use of carbocyanine dyes
                  as energy transfer acceptors for the study of biological processes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_excitation_kne98">In agreement with previous results reported for colloidal silver clusters, effective surface-enhanced Raman cross sections
                  of about 10-(16) cm(2) per molecule, corresponding to enhancement factors on the order of 10(14), have also been obtained
                  for molecules attached to colloidal gold clusters. Spatially isolated nearly spherical colloidal gold particles of about 60
                  nm size show maximum enhancement factors on the order of 10(3) at 514 nm excitation, close to the single plasmon resonance.
                  The enhancement factor increases by eleven orders of magnitude when colloidal gold clusters are formed by aggregation of the
                  gold colloids and when near-infrared excitation is applied. The large effective surface-enhanced Raman cross section has been
                  estimated by a straightforward method based on steady-state population redistribution due to the pumping of molecules to the
                  first excited vibrational state via the strongly enhanced Raman process. Our experimental finding confirms the important role
                  of colloidal clusters for extremely large surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement factors. Simultaneously, it
                  suggests colloidal gold clusters as a substrate for high-sensitivity surface-enhanced Raman scattering, which can provide
                  an enhancement level sufficient for Raman single molecule detection. Due to its chemical inactivity, gold might have some
                  advantages compared to silver, particularly in biomedical spectroscopy.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_excited_states_and04">We present a model to evaluate the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of electronic excited states of a molecule close to
                  a metal particle of complex shape and, possibly, in the presence of a solvent. The molecule is treated quantum mechanically
                  at Hartree?Fock (HF) or density-functional theory (DFT) level. The metal/solvent is considered as a continuous body, characterized
                  by its frequency dependent local dielectric constant. For simple metal shapes (planar infinite surface and spherical particle)
                  a version of the polarizable continuum model based on the integral equation formalism has been used, while an alternative
                  methodology has been implemented to treat metal particles of arbitrary shape. In both cases, equations have been numerically
                  solved using a boundary element method. Excitation energies and nonradiative decay rates due to the energy transfer from the
                  molecule to the metal are evaluated exploiting the linear response theory (TDHF or TDDFT where TD?time dependent). The radiative
                  decay rate of the whole system (molecule+metal/solvent) is calculated, still using a continuum model, in terms of the response
                  of the surrounding to the molecular transition. The model presented has been applied to the study of the radiative and nonradiative
                  lifetimes of a lissamine molecule in solution (water) and close to gold spherical nanoparticles of different radius. In addition,
                  the influence of the metal shape has been analyzed by performing calculations on a system composed by a coumarin-type molecule
                  close to silver aggregates of complex shape.

                  approach, where the transition dipole moment acts as the source of the emission field. The emission in the presence of semiinfinite
                  media, metallic nanorings, spheres, gratings, and other complex geometries is investigated. Strong emission enhancement effects
                  are obtained in some of these geometries associated to the excitation of plasmons (e.g., in nanorings or spheres). Furthermore,
                  the emission is shown to take place only along narrow angular distributions when the atom is located inside a low-index dielectric
                  and near its planar surface, or when metallic nanogratings are employed at certain resonant wave lengths. In particular, axially
                  symmetric gratings made of real silver metal are considered, and both emission rate enhancement and focused far-field emission
                  are achieved simultaneously when the grating is decorated with further nanostructures.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_excited_states_cor03">We present a model for the evaluation of the metal-induced deexcitation rate for molecules close to a metal surface. In this
                  model, the molecule is treated quantum mechanically at the density-functional theory level and its excitations with a time-dependent
                  density-functional theory procedure. The metal is described through its dielectric response properties. The nonlocal features
                  of such a response are taken into account by using a modified Lindhard-Mermin dielectric constant. The presence of small random
                  roughness on the metal surface is described with the model of Rahman and Maradudin [Phys. Rev. B 21, 504 (1980)]. Systems
                  in which the molecule close to the metal is immersed in an homogeneous matrix or deposited on a spacer are considered. The
                  matrix and the spacer are treated with the polarizable continuum model. The molecule-metal and the molecule-matrix (or molecule-spacer)
                  electrostatic interactions are described by using the integral equation formalism, numerically treated with a boundary element
                  method. As a test case, the method has been applied to the study of phosphorescence from biacetyl close to a silver surface
                  and immersed in or deposited on solid ammonia. Our results show that nonlocal metal response and surface roughness have an
                  important role in explaining measured lifetimes.

                  planar dielectric surfaces and near single small dielectric particles to situations where the molecule is adsorbed on a cluster
                  made of several dielectric spherical grains. The nonradiative relaxation rate is seen to be relatively weakly dependent on
                  the cluster structure and, if the molecule is adsorbed on one of the grains, is well approximated by the single grain result.
                  The radiative decay rate and hence the quantum yield are much more sensitive to the geometry of the cluster which determines
                  the position (in frequency) of the dielectric resonances of the cluster. The formalism developed here may be used to evaluate

                  total decay rate of the emitting dipole is obtained by considering the two mechanisms through which energy is dissipated.
                  One is the radiative loss, which is calculated from the Poynting vector, and the other is the nonradiative decay which is
                  calculated from the Ohmic losses inside the sphere. Numerical computations are performed for the case of a molecule near a

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_excited_states_bar05">Excited-state interactions between chlorophyll a (Chla) and gold nanoparticles have been studied. The emission intensity of
                  Chla is quenched by gold nanoparticles. The dominant process for this quenching has been attributed to the process of photoinduced
                  electron transfer from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, although because of a small overlap between fluorescence of Chla
                  and absorption of gold nanoparticles, the energy-transfer process cannot be ruled out. Photoinduced electron-transfer mechanism
                  is supported by the electrochemical modulation of fluorescence of Chla. In absence of an applied bias, Chla cast on gold film,
                  as a result of electron transfer, exhibits a very weak fluorescence. However, upon negatively charging the gold nanocore by
                  external bias, an increase in fluorescence intensity is observed. The negatively charged gold nanoparticles create a barrier
                  and suppress the electron-transfer process from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, resulting in an increase in radiative
                  process. Nanosecond laser flash experiments of Chla in the presence of gold nanoparticles and fullerene (C-60) have demonstrated
                  that Au nanoparticles, besides accepting electrons, can also mediate or shuttle electrons to another acceptor. Taking advantage
                  of these properties of gold nanoparticles, a photoelectrochemical cell based on Chla and gold nanoparticles is constructed.
                  A superior performance of this cell compared to that without the gold film is due to the beneficial role of gold nanoparticles
                  in accepting and shuttling the photogenerated electrons in Chla to the collecting electrode, leading to an enhancement in
                  charge separation efficiency.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_excitons_gov03">We describe a mechanism of spin transfer between individual quantum dots without tunneling. Incident circularly polarized
                  photons create interband excitons with nonzero electron spin in the first quantum dot. When the quantum-dot pair is properly
                  designed, this excitation can be transferred to the neighboring dot via the Coulomb interaction with conservation or flipping
                  of electron spin. The second dot can radiate circularly polarized photons at smaller energy. Selection rules for spin transfer
                  are determined by the resonant conditions and by the strong spin-orbit interaction in the valence band of nanocrystals. Coulomb-induced
                  energy and spin transfer in pairs and chains of dots can become very efficient under resonant conditions. The electron can
                  preserve its spin orientation even in randomly oriented nanocrystals.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_excitons_gov05">The mechanisms of energy and spin transfer in quantum dot pairs coupled via the Coulomb interaction are studied. Exciton transfer
                  can be resonant or phonon-assisted. In both cases, the transfer rates strongly depend on the resonance conditions. The spin
                  selection rules in the transfer process come from the exchange and spin-orbit interactions. The character of energy dissipation
                  in spin transfer is different than that in the traditional spin currents. The spin-dependent photon cross-correlation functions
                  reflect the exciton transfer process. In addition, a mathematical method to calculate FÃ¶rster transfer in crystalline nanostructures
                  beyond the dipole-dipole approximation is described.

                  id="abstract_fermi_level_equilibration_bar05">Excited-state interactions between chlorophyll a (Chla) and gold nanoparticles have been studied. The emission intensity of
                  Chla is quenched by gold nanoparticles. The dominant process for this quenching has been attributed to the process of photoinduced
                  electron transfer from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, although because of a small overlap between fluorescence of Chla
                  and absorption of gold nanoparticles, the energy-transfer process cannot be ruled out. Photoinduced electron-transfer mechanism
                  is supported by the electrochemical modulation of fluorescence of Chla. In absence of an applied bias, Chla cast on gold film,
                  as a result of electron transfer, exhibits a very weak fluorescence. However, upon negatively charging the gold nanocore by
                  external bias, an increase in fluorescence intensity is observed. The negatively charged gold nanoparticles create a barrier
                  and suppress the electron-transfer process from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, resulting in an increase in radiative
                  process. Nanosecond laser flash experiments of Chla in the presence of gold nanoparticles and fullerene (C-60) have demonstrated
                  that Au nanoparticles, besides accepting electrons, can also mediate or shuttle electrons to another acceptor. Taking advantage
                  of these properties of gold nanoparticles, a photoelectrochemical cell based on Chla and gold nanoparticles is constructed.
                  A superior performance of this cell compared to that without the gold film is due to the beneficial role of gold nanoparticles
                  in accepting and shuttling the photogenerated electrons in Chla to the collecting electrode, leading to an enhancement in
                  charge separation efficiency.

                  a future information technology, based on single-electron devices. This article gives an overview about the strategies used

                  colloid containing Dy3+ were measured. For solution containing Dy3+, fluorescence emission occurs at visible light wavelength
                  region. Two emission peaks are observed at 480 nm and 570 nm respectively when the corresponding excitation wavelength is
                  at 350 nm. When An colloids were added to the solution containing Dy3+, both these two fluorescence peaks were enhanced. Furthermore,

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_films_joh05">We present a general model study of surface-enhanced resonant Raman scattering and fluorescence, focusing on the interplay
                  between electromagnetic (EM) effects and the molecular dynamics as treated by a density matrix calculation. The model molecule
                  has two electronic levels, is affected by radiative and nonradiative damping mechanisms, and a Franck-Condon mechanism yields
                  electron-vibration coupling. The coupling between the molecule and the electromagnetic field is enhanced by placing it between
                  two Ag nanoparticles. The results show that the Raman scattering cross section can, for realistic parameter values, increase
                  by some 10 orders of magnitude (to similar to 10(-14) cm(2)) compared with the free-space case. Also the fluorescence cross
                  section grows with increasing EM enhancement, however, at a slower rate, and this increase eventually stalls when nonradiative
                  decay processes become important. Finally, we find that anti-Stokes Raman scattering is possible with strong incident laser
                  intensities similar to 1 mW/mu m(2).

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_films_xux4">It is well known that surface plasmon absorption (color) of Au nanoparticles highly depends on its size, shape, and surrounding
                  surface environment, providing a great opportunity for the development of Au nanoparticles as a probe for chemical and biochemical
                  sensing and as a building block for nano-optical devices. Currently, it remains incompletely understood how the surface properties
                  of Au nanoparticles ultimately define its optical properties, hindering the progress of rational design of Au nanoparticles
                  for biochemical sensing and assembly of nano-optical devices. Ru(bpy)32+ possesses rich photochemical and electrochemical
                  properties, offering a unique probe to study the surface environment of Au nanoparticles. In this study, we investigate the
                  kinetics of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles (6.5, 19, 48, 97 nm) in the presence of Ru(bpy)32+ at 24.0, 33.0,
                  and 51.0 C. We find that the color-change rate of Au nanoparticles is highly sensitive to the amount of Ru(bpy)32+. In addition,
                  the minimum (critical) concentration of Ru(bpy)32+ needed to change the color of Au nanoparticles is highly dependent upon
                  temperature and nanoparticle size. TEM images illustrate that the color-change mechanism of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+
                  highly depends on the size of nanoparticles. Control experiments using NaCl and MgCl2 to replace Ru(bpy)32+ show no color
                  change, suggesting that the color change of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+ is not solely attributable to the salt
                  effect. Other factors, such as adsorption of Ru(bpy)32+ on the Au nanoparticle surface, may be involved. Moreover, in the
                  presence of the critical concentration of Ru(bpy)32+, as temperature increases from 24.0 C to 51.0 C, the color-change rate
                  of 19 nm Au nanoparticles increases 8-fold, whereas the color-change rate of 48 nm Au nanoparticles decreases 3-fold, showing
                  the temperature dependence of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles in the presence of surface adsorbates, Ru(bpy)32+.

                  by using different mole ratios of silver nitrate/tiopronin. Ligands on the silver particles were partially displaced by fluorescein-labeled
                  thiolate single-stranded oligonucleotides or their complementary unlabeled oligonucleotides through ligand exchange. The fluorophores
                  on silver particles showed a surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF) dependent on the size of metallic cores. The particles could
                  be coupled through hybridizations of oligonucleotides bound on the particles. The coupled particles were aggregated due to
                  multiple displacements of oligonucleotides on each particle, resulting in stronger SEF. The dye-labeled oligonucleotides were
                  assembled on the silver islands on the solid substrate, and the complementary oligonucleotide-displaced particles were coupled
                  via oligonucleotide hybridization. The couplings between particles and islands resulted in an obvious fluorescence enhancement.

                  id="abstract_finite_element_analysis_hud03">A near-field optical imaging approach is demonstrated for simultaneous topographic and spectroscopic imaging with spatial
                  resolution beyond the optical diffraction limit. The method combines metallic-tip-based tapping-mode atomic force microscopy
                  (AFM) with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The AFM metallic tip was formed by sputter coating a Si tapping
                  mode tip with Au, in a way that forms a globular tip apex. Such tip apex generates high local electric field enhancement under
                  laser illumination, which provides a strong electric-field interaction between the AFM tip and the fluorescent molecules under
                  the tip. The tip perturbation of fluorescence gives the fluorescence lifetime changes that provide the AFM-FLIM imaging contrast.
                  A finite element method simulation was used to further evaluate the electric near-field enhancement and electric field distribution
                  originating from the metallic Au-coated AFM tapping-mode tip. We have demonstrated that spatially mapping the change in fluorescence
                  lifetime and intensity is a promising approach to spectroscopic imaging at an AFM spatial resolution typically defined by
                  the apex diameter of the AFM tips. The globular Au-coated AFM tip not only gives adequate spatial AFM tapping-mode imaging
                  spatial resolution but also is "environmentally friendly" to soft samples, such as polymeric dye-labeled nanospheres and even
                  biological specimens such as POPO-3 labeled DNA.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_flash_photolysis_bar05">Excited-state interactions between chlorophyll a (Chla) and gold nanoparticles have been studied. The emission intensity of
                  Chla is quenched by gold nanoparticles. The dominant process for this quenching has been attributed to the process of photoinduced
                  electron transfer from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, although because of a small overlap between fluorescence of Chla
                  and absorption of gold nanoparticles, the energy-transfer process cannot be ruled out. Photoinduced electron-transfer mechanism
                  is supported by the electrochemical modulation of fluorescence of Chla. In absence of an applied bias, Chla cast on gold film,
                  as a result of electron transfer, exhibits a very weak fluorescence. However, upon negatively charging the gold nanocore by
                  external bias, an increase in fluorescence intensity is observed. The negatively charged gold nanoparticles create a barrier
                  and suppress the electron-transfer process from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, resulting in an increase in radiative
                  process. Nanosecond laser flash experiments of Chla in the presence of gold nanoparticles and fullerene (C-60) have demonstrated
                  that Au nanoparticles, besides accepting electrons, can also mediate or shuttle electrons to another acceptor. Taking advantage
                  of these properties of gold nanoparticles, a photoelectrochemical cell based on Chla and gold nanoparticles is constructed.
                  A superior performance of this cell compared to that without the gold film is due to the beneficial role of gold nanoparticles
                  in accepting and shuttling the photogenerated electrons in Chla to the collecting electrode, leading to an enhancement in
                  charge separation efficiency.

                  used spectral analogues listed above. In addition, Alexa dyes are insensitive to pH in the 4-10 range. We evaluated Alexa
                  dyes compared with conventional dyes in applications using various conjugates, including those of goat anti-mouse IgG (GAM),
                  streptavidin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and concanavalin A (ConA). Conjugates of Alexa 546 are at least twofold more fluo-rescent

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_fluctuations_egg98">The photostability of fluorescent dyes is of crucial importance for the statistical accuracy of single-molecule detection
                  (SMD) and for the image quality of scanning confocal microscopy. Concurrent results for the photostability were obtained by
                  two different experimental techniques. First, the photostabilities of several coumarin and rhodamine derivatives in aqueous
                  solution were obtained by monitoring the steady-state fluorescence decay in a quartz cell. Furthermore, an epi-illuminated
                  microscope, continuous wave (CW) excitation at 514.5 nm, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with a newly developed
                  theory were used to study the photobleaching characteristics of rhodamines under conditions used for SMD. Depending on the
                  rhodamine structure, the probability of photobleaching, pb, is in the order of 10-6-10-7 for irradiances below 103 W/cm2.
                  However, a considerable increase of pb for irradiances above this level was observed which can only be described by photobleaching
                  reactions from higher excited states (two-step photolysis). In view of these observations, the probability of photobleaching,
                  pb, as well as a closed expression of its dependence on the CW excitation irradiance considering a five-level molecular electronic
                  state model with the possibility of photobleaching from higher excited electronic states, is derived. From this model, optimal
                  conditions for SMD with respect to the number of emitted fluorescence photons and to the signal-to-background ratio are discussed,
                  taking into account both saturation and photobleaching. The additional photobleaching due to two-step photolysis limits the
                  applicable irradiance.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_fluorescence_ang06">We present an experimental and theoretical study of the fluorescence rate of a single molecule as a function of its distance
                  to a laser-irradiated gold nanoparticle. The local field enhancement leads to an increased excitation rate whereas nonradiative
                  energy transfer to the particle leads to a decrease of the quantum yield (quenching). Because of these competing effects,
                  previous experiments showed either fluorescence enhancement or fluorescence quenching. By varying the distance between molecule
                  and particle we show the first experimental measurement demonstrating the continuous transition from fluorescence enhancement
                  to fluorescence quenching. This transition cannot be explained by treating the particle as a polarizable sphere in the dipole
                  approximation.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_fluorescence_asl04">A fluorescence-based detection scheme that uses ligand functionalized gold nanoparticles is proposed. The transduction scheme
                  is based on the strong quenching of the fluorescence emission exerted by metallic surfaces on fluorophores positioned in their
                  immediate vicinity (&lt;5 nm). Binding of fluorophore-labeled anti-biotin to biotinylated gold nanoparticles resulted in decreasedfluorescence
                  emission intensity. Subsequent competitive dissociation of labeled anti-biotin with D-biotin resulted in increased fluorescence
                  emission intensity. These interactions occurred by means of specific molecular recognition because when the binding sites
                  of anti-biotin were saturated with D-biotin prior to interaction with the gold nanoparticles; changes in the fluorescence
                  emission intensity were not observed.

                  are investigated by means of time-resolved fluorescence experiments. A pronounced fluorescence quenching is observed already
                  for the smallest nanoparticles of 1 nm radius. The quenching is caused not only by an increased nonradiative rate but, equally
                  important, by a drastic decrease in the dye's radiative rate. Assuming resonant energy transfer to be responsible for the
                  nonradiative decay channel, we compare our experimental findings with theoretical results derived from the Gersten-Nitzan

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_fluorescence_fan03">Gold nanoparticles quench the fluorescence of cationic polyfluorene with Stern-Volmer constants (KSV) approaching 1011 M-1,
                  several orders of magnitude larger than any previously reported conjugated polymer-quencher pair and 9-10 orders of magnitude
                  larger than small molecule dye-quencher pairs. The dependence of KSV on ionic strength, charge and conjugation length of the
                  polymer, and the dimensions (and thus optical properties) of the nanoparticles suggests that three factors account for this
                  extraordinary efficiency: (i) amplification of the quenching via rapid internal energy or electron transfer, (ii) electrostatic
                  interactions between the cationic polymer and anionic nanoparticles, and (iii) the ability of gold nanoparticles to quench
                  via efficient energy transfer. As a result of this extraordinarily high KSV, quenching can be observed even at subpicomolar
                  concentrations of nanoparticles, suggesting that the combination of conjugated polymers with these nanomaterials can potentially
                  lead to improved sensitivity in optical biosensors.

                  (Os(bpy)(3)(2+)) as phosphorescent labels for the quantification of surface binding of molecules to gold and silver nanoparticles.
                  The fraction of Rtt(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) that is in solution can be distinguished from the surface-bound fraction
                  by the relative lifetimes and integrated emission yields as determined by time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) spectroscopy.
                  Complementary steady-state measurements were carried out to confirm surface attachment of the phosphorescent label molecules.
                  Although the emission of solutions of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) is quenched proportional to the concentration of 10
                  nm Au or 20 nm Ag nanoparticles, the quenching is static and not diffusional quenching observed in Stern-Volmer plots. The
                  results demonstrate that time-resolved spectroscopy provides a rapid method for the measurement of surface binding of labeled
                  molecules on metallic nanoparticles. While steady-state measurements require the preparation of a series of samples with varying
                  quencher concentrations and a reference, the method described herein requires a single sample plus reference. The mechanism
                  for phosphorescence quenching on Au and Ag nanoparticles is discussed in terms of energy and electron transfer theories.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_fluorescence_hud03">A near-field optical imaging approach is demonstrated for simultaneous topographic and spectroscopic imaging with spatial
                  resolution beyond the optical diffraction limit. The method combines metallic-tip-based tapping-mode atomic force microscopy
                  (AFM) with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The AFM metallic tip was formed by sputter coating a Si tapping
                  mode tip with Au, in a way that forms a globular tip apex. Such tip apex generates high local electric field enhancement under
                  laser illumination, which provides a strong electric-field interaction between the AFM tip and the fluorescent molecules under
                  the tip. The tip perturbation of fluorescence gives the fluorescence lifetime changes that provide the AFM-FLIM imaging contrast.
                  A finite element method simulation was used to further evaluate the electric near-field enhancement and electric field distribution
                  originating from the metallic Au-coated AFM tapping-mode tip. We have demonstrated that spatially mapping the change in fluorescence
                  lifetime and intensity is a promising approach to spectroscopic imaging at an AFM spatial resolution typically defined by
                  the apex diameter of the AFM tips. The globular Au-coated AFM tip not only gives adequate spatial AFM tapping-mode imaging
                  spatial resolution but also is "environmentally friendly" to soft samples, such as polymeric dye-labeled nanospheres and even
                  biological specimens such as POPO-3 labeled DNA.

                  that, in the case of gold tips, the enhancement is due to resonant plasmon excitation. Consistently, no enhancement has been

                  nanoparticles in N,N-dimethylformamide. The formation of particle aggregates was observed upon mixing the particle solution
                  with the complex solution, in which the complexes behaved like linker molecules. Luminescent intensity of the complexes was
                  enhanced in the presence of silver nanoparticles, but at only a limited particle concentration region. The observed particle
                  concentration dependences of the luminescent intensity were regarded as the result of a delicate balance between an enhancing
                  and a quenching effect of the silver nanoparticles. In addition to the change in intensity, silver nanoparticles also affected
                  the asymmetric ratio (or monochromaticity) of the europium luminescence. These changes in the luminescent properties of the
                  complex were discussed in terms of the effects of particle aggregates and consequent modifications of the local electromagnetic
                  field, refractive index, and the ligand field around europium ion.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_fluorescence_sau95">The increased sensitivity together with the advent of low-cost optical sources and detectors in the visible-near IR region
                  has led us to current efforts to develop new efficient fluorescent labels for biodiagnostics with absorption and emission
                  beyond 600 nm. In view of the general fluorescence decrease with increasing emission wavelength, we investigated the possibility
                  to shift the absorption of rhodamine dyes toward the region 620-670 nm. The hydrophobic nature of all known long-wavelength
                  dyes results in the tendency to form intra- and intermolecular aggregates in hydrophilic solvents, especially in aqueous environment.
                  Due to the aggregation with biological materials, fluorescence quenching of the dyes is often observed. New strategies for
                  prevention of these processes are considered.

                  We show that the highest fluorescence enhancement is obtained for an emission wavelength redshifted from the plasmon resonance,

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_fluorescence_vie07">A phenomenological model is implemented to study the decay rates of fluorescing molecules in the vicinity of a metallic nanoparticle,
                  wherein the nonlocal optical response of the particle is accounted for via the hydrodynamic model for the description of the
                  free electrons in the metal. These nonlocal effects are examined for each of the radiative rate and the nonradiative rate
                  of the admolecule, respectively. In addition, the overall fluorescence rate which includes the enhancement ratio for the driving
                  field intensity is also studied. It is found that for particles of very small sizes (&lt;10 nm), the nonlocal effects, in general,
                  lead to significantly greater fluorescence rates and smaller nonradiative decay rates for the admolecules, with the effects
                  on radiative rates depending crucially on the orientation of the molecules. Furthermore, the effects are mostly noticeable
                  for molecules close to the metal particle and in processes where higher multipolar interactions are significant such as those
                  in nonradiative decay processes. Above all, these nonlocal effects can still be observable in the presence of large surface
                  damping imposed on the metallic electrons due to the ultrasmall sizes of these nanoparticles. The relevance of these effects
                  to some of the latest experiments is discussed.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_fluorescence_wei83">The enhancements of normal Raman scattering, resonance Raman scattering, and fluorescence from molecules adsorbed on identical,
                  well-characterized, silver-island films are reported. The enhancement arises from the electromagnetic interaction between
                  the molecules and the electronic plasma resonance of the silver islands. A hierarchy of enhancement ratios is found, with
                  typical values of 105 for RS, 103 for RRS and 10?1 to 10 for fluorescence, depending on the quantum yield of the molecular
                  fluorescence. A model, developed on heuristic grounds and substantiated using the density matrix formalism, describes the
                  light scattering processes and the effects of the plasma resonance. This model presents a unified picture of the surface-induced
                  enhancement effects and is consistent with the experimental values. The comparison of all the forms of optical scattering
                  leads to a complete determination of the role of the plasma resonances in the various portions of the scattering process.
                  The excitation of the electronic plasma resonance results in an increased local field at the molecules leading to an increased
                  excitation or absorption rate. Similarly, the excitation of the plasma resonance by the molecular emission dipole results
                  in an increase in the radiative decay rate. However, the electromagnetic coupling of the molecule to the plasma resonance
                  also adds an additional damping channel which can result in a reduction of the absorption or excitation rate as well as the
                  emission yield. The resultant balance of these processes leads to the hierarchy in the measured enhancements. The hierarchy
                  of enhancements is also shown to have important spectroscopic consequences.

                  id="abstract_fluorescence_correlation_spectroscopy_kne00">A method has been developed for highly sensitive detection of specific DNA sequences in a homogeneous assay using labeled
                  oligonucleotide molecules in combination with single-molecule photon burst counting and identification. The fluorescently
                  labeled oligonucleotides are called smart probes because they report the presence of complementary target sequences by a strong
                  increase in fluorescence intensity. The smart probes consist of a fluorescent dye attached at the terminus of a hairpin oligonucleotide.
                  The presented technique takes advantage of the fact that the used oxazine dye JA242 is efficiently quenched by complementary
                  guanosine residues. Upon specific hybridization to the target DNA, the smart probe undergoes a conformational change that
                  forces the fluorescent dye and the guanosine residues apart, thereby increasing the fluorescence intensity about six fold
                  in ensemble measurements. To increase the detection sensitivity below the nanomolar range, a confocal fluorescence microscope
                  was used to observe the fluorescence bursts from individual smart probes in the presence and absence of target DNA as they
                  passed through the focused laser beam. Smart probes were excited by a pulsed diode laser emitting at 635 nm with a repetition
                  rate of 64 MHz. Each fluorescence burst was identified by three independent parameters: (a) the burst size, (b) the burst
                  duration, and (c) the fluorescence lifetime. Through the use of this multiparameter analysis, higher discrimination accuracies
                  between smart probes and hybridized probe-target duplexes were achieved. The presented multiparameter detection technique
                  permits the identification of picomolar target DNA concentrations in a homogeneous assay, i.e., the detection of specific
                  DNA sequences in a 200-fold excess of labeled probe molecules.

                  and absorption of gold nanoparticles, the energy-transfer process cannot be ruled out. Photoinduced electron-transfer mechanism
                  is supported by the electrochemical modulation of fluorescence of Chla. In absence of an applied bias, Chla cast on gold film,
                  as a result of electron transfer, exhibits a very weak fluorescence. However, upon negatively charging the gold nanocore by
                  external bias, an increase in fluorescence intensity is observed. The negatively charged gold nanoparticles create a barrier
                  and suppress the electron-transfer process from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, resulting in an increase in radiative
                  process. Nanosecond laser flash experiments of Chla in the presence of gold nanoparticles and fullerene (C-60) have demonstrated
                  that Au nanoparticles, besides accepting electrons, can also mediate or shuttle electrons to another acceptor. Taking advantage
                  of these properties of gold nanoparticles, a photoelectrochemical cell based on Chla and gold nanoparticles is constructed.
                  A superior performance of this cell compared to that without the gold film is due to the beneficial role of gold nanoparticles
                  in accepting and shuttling the photogenerated electrons in Chla to the collecting electrode, leading to an enhancement in
                  charge separation efficiency.

                  inside and outside a stratified sphere consisting of concentric spherical shells. There is no limitation on the dipole position,
                  the number of the concentric shells, the shell medium, or on the sphere radius. Electromagnetic fields are determined anywhere
                  in the space, the time-averaged angular distribution of the radiated power, the total radiated power, Ohmic losses due to
                  an absorbing shell, and Green?s function are calculated. An absorbing, optically active, and ultrathin (less, approximate10
                  nm) metallic shell (core), characterized by a nonlocal dielectric function, are all allowed. The classical results are then
                  applied to inelastic light scattering (fluorescence and Raman), the radiative and nonradiative normalized decay rates, and
                  frequency shift. Using correspondence principle, the radiative decay rate is calculated from the Poynting vector, whereas
                  the nonradiative decay rate is calculated from the Ohmic losses inside a sphere absorptive shell. Numerical stability of our
                  method and limitations of classical description of decay rates are addressed. The importance of grouping various radiative
                  and nonradiative decay mechanisms into local and nonlocal decay rates is emphasized. Further possible extensions of the theory
                  presented here to the case of an arbitrary multilayered (axially symmetric) particle and to the classical problem of a radiating
                  quadrupole in the presence of a multilayered particle are briefly outlined. Various applications for chemical speciation,
                  LIDAR, fluorescent microscopy, engineering of decay rates, identification of biological particles, and monitoring specific
                  cell functions are envisaged. Computer program is freely available at http://www.wave-scattering.com.

                  id="abstract_fractal_silver_structures_ged03a">Substantial increases in fluorescence emission from fluorophore-protein-coated fractal-like silver structures have been observed.
                  We review two methods for silver fractal structure preparation, which have been employed and studied. The first, a roughened
                  silver electrode, typically yielded a 100-fold increase in fluorophore emission, and the second, silver fractal-like structures
                  grown on glass between two silver electrodes, produced a [ap]500-fold increase. In addition, significant increases in probe
                  photostability were observed for probes coated on the silver fractal like structures. These results further serve to compliment
                  our recent work on the effects of nobel metal particles with fluorophores, a relatively new phenomenon in fluorescence we
                  have termed both 'metal-enhanced fluorescence' [1] and 'radiative decay engineering' [2,3]. These results are explained by
                  the metallic surfaces modifying the radiative decay rate ([Gamma]) of the fluorescent labels. We believe that this new silver-surface
                  preparation, which results in ultrabright and photostable fluorophores, offers a new generic technology platform for increased
                  fluorescence signal levels, with widespread potential applications to the analytical sciences, imaging, and medical diagnostics.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_free_radicals_cor03">We present a model for the evaluation of the metal-induced deexcitation rate for molecules close to a metal surface. In this
                  model, the molecule is treated quantum mechanically at the density-functional theory level and its excitations with a time-dependent
                  density-functional theory procedure. The metal is described through its dielectric response properties. The nonlocal features
                  of such a response are taken into account by using a modified Lindhard-Mermin dielectric constant. The presence of small random
                  roughness on the metal surface is described with the model of Rahman and Maradudin [Phys. Rev. B 21, 504 (1980)]. Systems
                  in which the molecule close to the metal is immersed in an homogeneous matrix or deposited on a spacer are considered. The
                  matrix and the spacer are treated with the polarizable continuum model. The molecule-metal and the molecule-matrix (or molecule-spacer)
                  electrostatic interactions are described by using the integral equation formalism, numerically treated with a boundary element
                  method. As a test case, the method has been applied to the study of phosphorescence from biacetyl close to a silver surface
                  and immersed in or deposited on solid ammonia. Our results show that nonlocal metal response and surface roughness have an
                  important role in explaining measured lifetimes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_front_joh05">We present a general model study of surface-enhanced resonant Raman scattering and fluorescence, focusing on the interplay
                  between electromagnetic (EM) effects and the molecular dynamics as treated by a density matrix calculation. The model molecule
                  has two electronic levels, is affected by radiative and nonradiative damping mechanisms, and a Franck-Condon mechanism yields
                  electron-vibration coupling. The coupling between the molecule and the electromagnetic field is enhanced by placing it between
                  two Ag nanoparticles. The results show that the Raman scattering cross section can, for realistic parameter values, increase
                  by some 10 orders of magnitude (to similar to 10(-14) cm(2)) compared with the free-space case. Also the fluorescence cross
                  section grows with increasing EM enhancement, however, at a slower rate, and this increase eventually stalls when nonradiative
                  decay processes become important. Finally, we find that anti-Stokes Raman scattering is possible with strong incident laser
                  intensities similar to 1 mW/mu m(2).

                  branched DNA trimers and nanoparticle-DNA conjugates results in the synthesis of nanoparticle trimer and tetramer complexes.
                  Multiple tetramer architectures are investigated, utilizing Au-DNA conjugates with varying secondary structural motifs. Hybridization
                  products are analyzed by gel electrophoresis, and discrete bands are observed corresponding to structures with increasing

                  colloid containing Dy3+ were measured. For solution containing Dy3+, fluorescence emission occurs at visible light wavelength
                  region. Two emission peaks are observed at 480 nm and 570 nm respectively when the corresponding excitation wavelength is
                  at 350 nm. When An colloids were added to the solution containing Dy3+, both these two fluorescence peaks were enhanced. Furthermore,
                  with the increasing Au content, the fluorescence increases first and then decreases. We believe that this increased fluorescence
                  are due to the local field enhancement around Dy3+ ions owing to the induced higher orders of surface plasmon resonance. (c)

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_gold_and04">We present a model to evaluate the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of electronic excited states of a molecule close to
                  a metal particle of complex shape and, possibly, in the presence of a solvent. The molecule is treated quantum mechanically
                  at Hartree?Fock (HF) or density-functional theory (DFT) level. The metal/solvent is considered as a continuous body, characterized
                  by its frequency dependent local dielectric constant. For simple metal shapes (planar infinite surface and spherical particle)
                  a version of the polarizable continuum model based on the integral equation formalism has been used, while an alternative
                  methodology has been implemented to treat metal particles of arbitrary shape. In both cases, equations have been numerically
                  solved using a boundary element method. Excitation energies and nonradiative decay rates due to the energy transfer from the
                  molecule to the metal are evaluated exploiting the linear response theory (TDHF or TDDFT where TD?time dependent). The radiative
                  decay rate of the whole system (molecule+metal/solvent) is calculated, still using a continuum model, in terms of the response
                  of the surrounding to the molecular transition. The model presented has been applied to the study of the radiative and nonradiative
                  lifetimes of a lissamine molecule in solution (water) and close to gold spherical nanoparticles of different radius. In addition,
                  the influence of the metal shape has been analyzed by performing calculations on a system composed by a coumarin-type molecule
                  close to silver aggregates of complex shape.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_gold_ang06">We present an experimental and theoretical study of the fluorescence rate of a single molecule as a function of its distance
                  to a laser-irradiated gold nanoparticle. The local field enhancement leads to an increased excitation rate whereas nonradiative
                  energy transfer to the particle leads to a decrease of the quantum yield (quenching). Because of these competing effects,
                  previous experiments showed either fluorescence enhancement or fluorescence quenching. By varying the distance between molecule
                  and particle we show the first experimental measurement demonstrating the continuous transition from fluorescence enhancement
                  to fluorescence quenching. This transition cannot be explained by treating the particle as a polarizable sphere in the dipole
                  approximation.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_gold_bru05">Progress in near-field optical spectroscopy research on metal narroparticles demands a better understanding of the role of
                  particle-particle and tip-sample interactions. In this perspective, we investigate theoretically, at a very moderate level
                  of sophistication, the optical behavior of simple silver nanoparticle aggregates, in terms of a formalism involving a multipolar
                  expansion of the fields involved, along with a simplified model for the optical behavior of nanostructures previously developed.
                  In particular, the tip-sample interaction is taken into account roughly, treating the tip as an additional, single particle,
                  characterized by proper dielectric behavior.

                  of our data with theoretical models allows determination of the quantum efficiency of each radiating dipole.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_gold_dul02">The radiative and nonradiative decay rates of lissamine dye molecules, chemically attached to differently sized gold nanoparticles,
                  are investigated by means of time-resolved fluorescence experiments. A pronounced fluorescence quenching is observed already
                  for the smallest nanoparticles of 1 nm radius. The quenching is caused not only by an increased nonradiative rate but, equally
                  important, by a drastic decrease in the dye's radiative rate. Assuming resonant energy transfer to be responsible for the
                  nonradiative decay channel, we compare our experimental findings with theoretical results derived from the Gersten-Nitzan
                  model.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_gold_gou05">In this paper, the fabrication, characterization, and application of unique layer-by-layer (LBL) films of dendrimers and metallic
                  nanoparticles is reported. Silver nanoparticles (d = Â 20 nm) are produced in solution by sodium citrate reduction and incorporated
                  into thin films with generation 1 and 5 DAB-Am dendrimers (polypropylenimine dendrimers with amino surface groups) by the
                  LBL technique. The resulting nanocomposite films are characterized by UV-visible surface plasmon absorption and atomic force
                  microscopy (AFM) measurements, and employed as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of 2-naphthalenethiol.
                  Through variation of the molecular size (dendrimer generation) and concentration of the cross-linker used, as well as the
                  number of layers produced, the optical properties of several different possible architectures are studied. In the films, Ag
                  nanoparticles are shown to be effectively immobilized and stabilized with increased control over their spacing and aggregation.
                  Moreover, the films are shown to be excellent substrates for SERS measurements, demonstrating significant enhancement capability.
                  As expected, large electromagnetic enhancement of Raman scattering signals is found to be strongly dependent on interparticle
                  coupling between neighboring metallic nanoparticles. Finally, the possibility of detecting SERS signals from architectures
                  with intervening layers between the metal nanoparticles and analyte molecules is explored. It is shown that although there
                  are decreases in intensity with increasing number of intervening layers (as is expected from the distance dependence of SERS),
                  electromagnetic enhancement is still able to function at these distances, thus offering the possibility of developing sensors
                  with external layers that are chemically selective for specific analytes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_gold_gue04">We report the study of the quenching of quantum dots (CdSe) by gold nanoparticles at the single-molecule level. Double-stranded
                  DNA is used as a rigid spacer to tune the distance between the two nanoparticles. The width of the fluorescent intensity distribution,
                  monitored at different interparticle distances, reflects both the nanoparticle heterogeneity and the fluorescence intermittency
                  of the quantum dot. The fluorescence distribution emitted by single CdSe nanocrystals can easily be distinguished from the
                  fluorescence of partially quenched CdSe. Our results show that the distance-dependence quenching is compatible with a FÃ¶rster-type

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_gold_hai00">Recent advances in gold technology have led to probes with improved properties and performance for cell biologists: higher
                  labeling density, better sensitivity, and greater penetration into tissues. Gold clusters, such as the 1.4-nm Nanogold, are
                  gold compounds that can be covalently linked to Fab' antibody fragments, making small and stable probes. Silver enhancement
                  then makes these small gold particles easily visible by EM, LM, and directly by eye. Another advance is the combination of
                  fluorescent and gold probes for correlative microscopy. Chemical crosslinking of gold particles to many biologically active
                  molecules has made possible many novel probes, such as gold?lipids, gold?Ni?NTA, and gold?ATP.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_gold_hud03">A near-field optical imaging approach is demonstrated for simultaneous topographic and spectroscopic imaging with spatial
                  resolution beyond the optical diffraction limit. The method combines metallic-tip-based tapping-mode atomic force microscopy
                  (AFM) with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The AFM metallic tip was formed by sputter coating a Si tapping
                  mode tip with Au, in a way that forms a globular tip apex. Such tip apex generates high local electric field enhancement under
                  laser illumination, which provides a strong electric-field interaction between the AFM tip and the fluorescent molecules under
                  the tip. The tip perturbation of fluorescence gives the fluorescence lifetime changes that provide the AFM-FLIM imaging contrast.
                  A finite element method simulation was used to further evaluate the electric near-field enhancement and electric field distribution
                  originating from the metallic Au-coated AFM tapping-mode tip. We have demonstrated that spatially mapping the change in fluorescence
                  lifetime and intensity is a promising approach to spectroscopic imaging at an AFM spatial resolution typically defined by
                  the apex diameter of the AFM tips. The globular Au-coated AFM tip not only gives adequate spatial AFM tapping-mode imaging
                  spatial resolution but also is "environmentally friendly" to soft samples, such as polymeric dye-labeled nanospheres and even
                  biological specimens such as POPO-3 labeled DNA.

                  that, in the case of gold tips, the enhancement is due to resonant plasmon excitation. Consistently, no enhancement has been
                  observed using Pt/Ir tips.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_gold_mue02">A concept to electrically control the scattering of light is introduced. The idea is to embed noble metal nanoparticles in
                  an electro-optical material such as a liquid crystal in order to induce a spectral shift of the particle plasmon resonance
                  by applying an electric field. Light scattering experiments on single gold nanoparticles show that spherically shaped nanoparticles
                  become optically spheroidal when covered by an anisotropic liquid crystal. The two particle plasmon resonances of the optically

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_gold_soe00">We have developed a simple, fast, and flexible technique to measure optical scattering spectra of individual metallic nanoparticles.
                  The particles are placed in an evanescent field produced by total internal reflection of light from a halogen lamp in a glass
                  prism. The light scattered by individual particles is collected using a conventional microscope and is spectrally analyzed
                  by a nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled-device array coupled to a spectrometer. This technique is employed to measure the effect
                  of particle diameter on the dephasing time of the particle plasmon resonance in gold nanoparticles. We also demonstrate the
                  use of this technique for measurements in liquids, which is important for the potential application of particle plasmons in
                  chemical or biological nanosensors.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_gold_sto97">In this review, we focus on some of the most successful approaches to date for organizing nanoparticles into macroscopic aggregates
                  and functional materials. The preparation and resulting properties of two- and three-dimensional arrays of nanoparticles are
                  detailed, and some potential uses for these materials are discussed. Although many types of nanoparticles can be organized
                  into such structures, this review focuses specifically on Au and CdE (E=S, Se) nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles are easily
                  prepared, highly stable, well-studied, and excellent models for other metal colloids. CdE colloids are the most extensively
                  studied semiconductor nanoparticles and hold much promise in the optoelectronics field.

                  lifetime and the fluorescence rate of single molecules are recorded simultaneously as a function of the tip position relative

                  be coupled through hybridizations of oligonucleotides bound on the particles. The coupled particles were aggregated due to
                  multiple displacements of oligonucleotides on each particle, resulting in stronger SEF. The dye-labeled oligonucleotides were
                  assembled on the silver islands on the solid substrate, and the complementary oligonucleotide-displaced particles were coupled
                  via oligonucleotide hybridization. The couplings between particles and islands resulted in an obvious fluorescence enhancement.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_gold_clusters_hai00">Recent advances in gold technology have led to probes with improved properties and performance for cell biologists: higher
                  labeling density, better sensitivity, and greater penetration into tissues. Gold clusters, such as the 1.4-nm Nanogold, are
                  gold compounds that can be covalently linked to Fab' antibody fragments, making small and stable probes. Silver enhancement
                  then makes these small gold particles easily visible by EM, LM, and directly by eye. Another advance is the combination of
                  fluorescent and gold probes for correlative microscopy. Chemical crosslinking of gold particles to many biologically active
                  molecules has made possible many novel probes, such as gold?lipids, gold?Ni?NTA, and gold?ATP.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_gold_colloids_gra95">The design and initial characterization of two-dimensional arrays of colloidal Au particles are reported. These surfaces are
                  prepared by self-assembly of 12 nn diameter colloidal Au particles onto immobilized polymers having pendant functional groups
                  with high affinity for Au (i.e., CN, SH, and NH2). The polymers are formed by condensation of functionalized alkoxysilanes
                  onto cleaned quartz, glass, and SiO2 surfaces. The assembly protocol is carried out completely in solution: cleaned substrates
                  are immersed in methanolic solutions of organosilane, rinsed, and subsequently immersed in aqueous colloidal Au solutions.
                  Two-dimensional arrays spontaneously form on the polymer surface, The resulting substrates have been characterized by UV-vis
                  spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). TEM data show that the
                  particles are spatially separated but close enough to interact electromagnetically (small spacing compared to lambda). The
                  UV-vis data show that collective particle surface plasmon modes are present in the 650-750 nm region, suggesting that these
                  assemblies are SERS-active. This is indeed the case, with enhancement factors of roughly 10(4). Au colloid monolayers possess
                  a set of features that make them very attractive for both basic and applied uses, including uniform roughness, high stability,
                  and biocompatibility.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_gold_labeling_hai00">Recent advances in gold technology have led to probes with improved properties and performance for cell biologists: higher
                  labeling density, better sensitivity, and greater penetration into tissues. Gold clusters, such as the 1.4-nm Nanogold, are
                  gold compounds that can be covalently linked to Fab' antibody fragments, making small and stable probes. Silver enhancement
                  then makes these small gold particles easily visible by EM, LM, and directly by eye. Another advance is the combination of
                  fluorescent and gold probes for correlative microscopy. Chemical crosslinking of gold particles to many biologically active
                  molecules has made possible many novel probes, such as gold?lipids, gold?Ni?NTA, and gold?ATP.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_gold_nanoparticles_asl05">Gold colloids are well known to display strong plasmon absorption bands due to electron oscillations induced by the incident
                  light. When the colloids are in proximity, the plasmon absorption bands are often perturbed. This has enabled us recently
                  to successfully develop a glucose sensing platform based on the disassociation of dextrancoated gold colloids, cross-linked
                  with Con A, by glucose. However, a much more useful and simpler property of gold colloids, which has been ill explored with
                  regard to sensing, is their ability to efficiently scatter excitation fight. We have found that our nanogold sensing aggregates
                  are indeed efficient light scatters around the nanogold plasmon absorption band. By measuring the ratio of scattered fight
                  intensities at two different arbitrary wavelengths, 560 and 680 nm, glucose concentrations can be readily determined from
                  a few millimolar up to similar to 60 mM, using a simple white light LED and detection system. Further, by measuring the ratio
                  of the scattered intensities, this sensing approach is independent of the total sensing aggregate concentration and the excitation
                  and detection instrumentation fluctuations or drifts. This simplistic and low-cost approach to glucose sensing, coupled with
                  the sensing aggreagates' ability to scatter red light, suggests the potential use of these aggregates for use in physiological
                  transdermal glucose monitoring, either for implantable skin sensors or glucose sensing tattoos (discussed later).

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_gold_nanoparticles_sey05">Efforts to improve the performance of immunoassays and immunosensors by incorporating different kinds of nanostructures have
                  gained considerable momentum over the last decade. Apart from liposomes, which will not be discussed here, most groups focus
                  on artificial, particulate marker systems, both organic and inorganic. The underlying detection procedures may be based either
                  on electro-magnetical or optical techniques. This review will be confined to the latter only, comprising nanoparticle applications
                  generating signals as diverse as static and time-resolved luminescence, one- and two-photon absorption, Raman and Rayleigh
                  scattering as well as surface plasmon resonance and others. In general, all endeavors cited are geared to achieve one or more
                  of the following goals: lowering of detection limits (if possible, down to single-molecule level), parallel integration of
                  multiple signals (multiplexing), signal amplification by several orders of magnitude and prevention of photobleaching effects
                  with concomitant maintenance of antigen binding specificity and sensitivity. Inorganic nanoparticle labels based on noble
                  metals, semiconductor quantum dots and nanoshells appear to be the most versatile systems for these bioanalytical applications
                  of nanophotonics. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_gold_nanoparticles_str05">In this work we report on the so-called plasmonic enhancement effect, whereby the presence of metallic surfaces or particles
                  in the vicinity of a fluorophore can dramatically alter the fluorescence emission and absorption properties of a fluorophore.
                  The effect, which is associated with the surface plasmon resonance of the metallic surface, depends on parameters such as
                  metal type, particle size, fluorophore type, and fluorophore-particle separation. This work focuses on the creation of metal
                  nanoparticle arrays by a lithographic process and on optimisation strategies to maximise the fluorescence enhancement of dyes
                  in the vicinity of the nanoparticles, for important applications such as fluorescence-based biochip platforms. Ordered arrays
                  of metallic nano-islands were fabricated on glass substrates by a process of natural lithography using monodisperse polystyrene
                  nanospheres. The metal particle dimensions were tailored in order to tune the plasmon resonance wavelength to match the spectral
                  absorption of the fluorophore. The fluorophore, Cy5 dye, which is widely used in optical immunoassays and has a medium quantum
                  efficiency (similar to 0.3), was used in this preliminary study of the plasmonic enhancement effect. The morphology of the
                  metallic arrays was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Absorption and
                  emission spectroscopies were used to elucidate the enhancement effect and its dependence on metal island morphology. Results
                  were correlated with existing theoretical models. The applicability of this important technique to sensor platforms, such
                  as fluorescence-based biochips, is also discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

                  colloid containing Dy3+ were measured. For solution containing Dy3+, fluorescence emission occurs at visible light wavelength
                  region. Two emission peaks are observed at 480 nm and 570 nm respectively when the corresponding excitation wavelength is
                  at 350 nm. When An colloids were added to the solution containing Dy3+, both these two fluorescence peaks were enhanced. Furthermore,
                  with the increasing Au content, the fluorescence increases first and then decreases. We believe that this increased fluorescence
                  are due to the local field enhancement around Dy3+ ions owing to the induced higher orders of surface plasmon resonance. (c)

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_gold_sols_alv05">In this work, the role of nanoparticle surface charge in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is examined for the common
                  case of measurements made in colloidal solutions of Ag and Au. Average SERS intensities obtained for several analytes (salicylic
                  acid, pyridine, and 2-naphthalenethiol) on Ag and An colloids are correlated with the pH and zeta potential (xi) values of
                  the nanoparticle solutions from which they were recorded. The consequence of the electrostatic interaction between the analyte
                  and the metallic nanoparticle is stressed. The xi potentials of three commonly used colloidal solutions are reported as a
                  function of pH, and a discussion is given on how these influence SERS intensity. Also examined is the importance of nanoparticle
                  aggregation (and colloidal solution collapse) in determining SERS intensities, and how this varies with the pH of the solution.
                  The results show that SERS enhancement is highest at xi potential values where the colloidal nanoparticle solutions are most
                  stable and where the electrostatic repulsion between the particles and the analyte molecules is minimized. These results suggest
                  some important criteria for consideration in all SERS measurements and also provide important insights into the problem of
                  predicting SERS activities for different molecular systems.

                  id="abstract_green_fluorescent_protein_hei05">We demonstrate that commercially available unmodified carbocyanine dyes such as Cy5 (usually excited at 633 nm) can be used
                  as efficient reversible single-molecule optical switch, whose fluorescent state after apparent photobleaching can be restored
                  at room temperature upon irradiation at shorter wavelengths. Ensemble photobleaching and recovery experiments of Cy5 in aqueous
                  solution irradiating first at 633 nm, then at 337, 488, or 532 nm, demonstrate that restoration of absorption and fluorescence
                  strongly depends on efficient oxygen removal and the addition of the triplet quencher -mercaptoethylamine. Single-molecule
                  fluorescence experiments show that individual immobilized Cy5 molecules can be switched optically in milliseconds by applying
                  alternating excitation at 633 and 488 nm between a fluorescent and nonfluorescent state up to 100 times with a reliability
                  of &gt;90% at room temperature. Because of their intriguing performance, carbocyanine dyes volunteer as a simple alternative
                  for ultrahigh-density optical data storage. Measurements on single donor/acceptor (tetramethylrhodamine/Cy5) labeled oligonucleotides
                  point out that the described light-driven switching behavior imposes fundamental limitations on the use of carbocyanine dyes
                  as energy transfer acceptors for the study of biological processes.

                  id="abstract_highly_fluorescent_analogs_asl05">Gold colloids are well known to display strong plasmon absorption bands due to electron oscillations induced by the incident
                  light. When the colloids are in proximity, the plasmon absorption bands are often perturbed. This has enabled us recently
                  to successfully develop a glucose sensing platform based on the disassociation of dextrancoated gold colloids, cross-linked
                  with Con A, by glucose. However, a much more useful and simpler property of gold colloids, which has been ill explored with
                  regard to sensing, is their ability to efficiently scatter excitation fight. We have found that our nanogold sensing aggregates
                  are indeed efficient light scatters around the nanogold plasmon absorption band. By measuring the ratio of scattered fight
                  intensities at two different arbitrary wavelengths, 560 and 680 nm, glucose concentrations can be readily determined from
                  a few millimolar up to similar to 60 mM, using a simple white light LED and detection system. Further, by measuring the ratio
                  of the scattered intensities, this sensing approach is independent of the total sensing aggregate concentration and the excitation
                  and detection instrumentation fluctuations or drifts. This simplistic and low-cost approach to glucose sensing, coupled with
                  the sensing aggreagates' ability to scatter red light, suggests the potential use of these aggregates for use in physiological
                  transdermal glucose monitoring, either for implantable skin sensors or glucose sensing tattoos (discussed later).

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_hla_class_i_ben05">Membrane topology of receptors plays an important role in shaping transmembrane signalling of cells. Among the methods used
                  for characterizing receptor clusters, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a donor and acceptor fluorophore plays
                  a unique role based on its capability of detecting molecular level (2-10 nm) proximities of receptors in physiological conditions.
                  Recent development of biotechnology has made possible the usage of colloidal gold particles in a large size range for specific
                  labelling of cells for the purposes of electron microscopy. However, by combining metal and fluorophore labelling or cells,
                  the versatility of metal-fluorophore interactions opens the way for new applications by detecting the presence of the metal
                  particles by the methods of fluorescence spectroscopy. An outstanding feature of the metal nanoparticle-fluorophore interaction
                  is that the metal particle can enhance spontaneous emission of the fluorophore in a distance-dependent fashion, in an interaction
                  range esentially determined by the size of the nanoparticle. In our work enhanced fluorescence of rhodamine and cyanine dyes
                  was observed in the vicinity of immunogold nanoparticles on the surface of JY cells in a flow cytometer. The dyes and the
                  immunogold were targetted to the cell surface receptors MHCI, MHCII, transferrin receptor and CD45 by monoclonal antibodies.
                  The fluorescence enhancement was sensitive to the wavelength of the exciting light, the size and amount of surface bound gold
                  beads, as well as the fluorophore-nanoparticle distance. The intensity of 90&amp;DEG; scattering of the incident light beam was
                  enhanced by the immunogold in a concentration and size-dependent fashion. The 90&amp;DEG; light scattering varied with the wavelength
                  of the incident light in a manner characteristic to gold nanoparticles of the applied sizes. A reduction in photobleaching
                  time constant of the cyanine dye was observed in the vicinity of gold particles in a digital imaging microscope. Modulations
                  of 90&amp;DEG; light scattering intensity and photobleaching time constant indicate the role of the local field in the fluorescence
                  enhancement. A mathematical simulation based on the electrodynamic theory of fluorescence enhancement showed a consistency
                  between the measured enhancement values, the inter-epitope distances and the quantum yields. The feasibility of realizing
                  proximity sensors operating at distance ranges larger than that of the conventional Forster transfer is demonstrated on the
                  surface of living cells. Copyright &amp;COPY; 2004 John Wiley&amp; Sons, Ltd.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_hybridization_lij05">In this paper, we had proposed a silicon integrated circuit (IC) compatible DNA-detection platform using photodiode and ordinary
                  optical illumination to detect DNA hybridization events occurred on the chip surface. The method utilizes gold nanoparticle
                  labeling and silver enhancement to generate opaque surface at area with target DNA hybridization. A photodiode fabricated
                  underneath the supporting surface can then be used to detect the light intensity changes, before and after the silver enhancement.
                  With this technique, we have successfully discriminated single base-mismatched DNA from matched DNA sequence, and the detection
                  limit could be as low as 10 pM. By exploiting the advanced modern IC manufacturing technology and the well-established electrochemical
                  immobilization of DNA, this approach has the potential to be used to construct a portable high-density DNA nanoarray system

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_hybridization_mar03">Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements were performed to elucidate the fluorescence quenching of oxazine,
                  rhodamine, carbocyanine, and bora-diaza-indacene dyes by amino acids. Among the natural amino acids, tryptophan exhibits the
                  most pronounced quenching efficiency. Especially, the red-absorbing dyes ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine derivative MR
                  121 are strongly quenched almost exclusively by tryptophan due to the formation of weak or nonfluorescent ground-state complexes
                  with association constants, Kass., ranging from 96 to 206 M-1. Rhodamine, fluorescein, and bora-diaza-indacene derivatives
                  that absorb at shorter wavelengths are also quenched substantially by tyrosine residues. The quenching of carbocyanine dyes,
                  such as Cy5, and Alexa 647 by amino acids can be almost neglected. While quenching of ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine
                  derivative MR121 by tryptophan is dominated by static quenching, dynamic quenching is more efficient for the two bora-diaza-indacene
                  dyes Bodipy-FL and Bodipy630/650. Labeling of the dyes to tryptophan, tryptophan-containing peptides, and proteins (streptavidin)
                  demonstrates that knowledge of these fluorescence quenching processes is crucial for the development of fluorescence-based
                  diagnostic assays. Changes in the fluorescence quantum yield of dye-labeled peptides and proteins might be used advantageously
                  for the quantification of proteases and specific binding partners.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_hybridization_sto02">The binding affinity of deoxynucleosides (dA, dG, dC, and dT) to gold nanoparticles was studied using a colorimetric assay
                  to determine if nucleobase sequence may play a role in binding alkanethiol-capped oligonucleotides to gold nanoparticles.
                  These data indicate that the deoxynucleoside dT has a much lower binding affinity to the gold nanoparticle surface than the
                  deoxynucleosides dG, dC, and dA. These data can be correlated with a previous study in our lab which indicated that alkanethiol-capped
                  oligonucleotides containing (dT)20 spacers have a significantly higher surface coverage than oligonucleotides containing (dA)20
                  spacers. To probe the physical consequences of this phenomenon, gold nanoparticles were loaded with alkanethiol-capped poly
                  dT, dA, and dC oligonucleotide sequences of 5-20 bases in length, and the stabilities of the particles in electrolytic media
                  were measured by monitoring a colorimetric change associated with particle agglomeration. The gold nanoparticles loaded with
                  alkanethiol-capped poly dT oligonucleotides exhibited a dramatic increase in stability as the oligonucleotide length was increased
                  from 5 to 20 bases. By comparison, gold nanoparticles loaded with poly dC and poly dA sequences exhibited only a slight increase
                  in stability as the oligonucleotide length was increased. The sequence-dependent stability observed for the DNA-modified gold
                  nanoparticles is attributed to the weaker interaction of the deoxynucleoside dT with the gold nanoparticle surface which results
                  in higher surface coverages and consequently enhanced stability as the oligonucleotide length is increased.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_hybridization_sto98">Selective colorimetric polynucleotide detection based on Au nanoparticle probes which align in a "tail-to-tail" fashion onto
                  a target polynucleotide is described. In this new nanoparticle-based detection system, Au particles (Â 13 nm diameter), which
                  are capped with 3'- and 5'-(alkanethiol)oligonucleotides, are used to complex a 24-base polynucleotide target. Hybridization
                  of the target with the probes results in the formation of an extended polymeric Au nanoparticle/polynucleotide aggregate,
                  which triggers a red to purple color change in solution. The color change is due to a red shift in the surface plasmon resonance
                  of the Au nanoparticles. The aggregates exhibit characteristic, exceptionally sharp "melting transitions" (monitored at 260
                  or 700 nm), which allows one to distinguish target sequences that contain one base end mismatches, deletions, or an insertion
                  from the fully complementary target. When test solutions are spotted onto a C18 reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography plate,
                  color differentiation is enhanced and a permanent record of the test is obtained, thereby providing a better method for distinguishing
                  the aforementioned target sequences. Significantly, one-pot colorimetric detection of the target in the presence of four strands
                  with single base imperfections can be accomplished with this new probe system

                  be coupled through hybridizations of oligonucleotides bound on the particles. The coupled particles were aggregated due to
                  multiple displacements of oligonucleotides on each particle, resulting in stronger SEF. The dye-labeled oligonucleotides were
                  assembled on the silver islands on the solid substrate, and the complementary oligonucleotide-displaced particles were coupled
                  via oligonucleotide hybridization. The couplings between particles and islands resulted in an obvious fluorescence enhancement.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_identification_egg98">The photostability of fluorescent dyes is of crucial importance for the statistical accuracy of single-molecule detection
                  (SMD) and for the image quality of scanning confocal microscopy. Concurrent results for the photostability were obtained by
                  two different experimental techniques. First, the photostabilities of several coumarin and rhodamine derivatives in aqueous
                  solution were obtained by monitoring the steady-state fluorescence decay in a quartz cell. Furthermore, an epi-illuminated
                  microscope, continuous wave (CW) excitation at 514.5 nm, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with a newly developed
                  theory were used to study the photobleaching characteristics of rhodamines under conditions used for SMD. Depending on the
                  rhodamine structure, the probability of photobleaching, pb, is in the order of 10-6-10-7 for irradiances below 103 W/cm2.
                  However, a considerable increase of pb for irradiances above this level was observed which can only be described by photobleaching
                  reactions from higher excited states (two-step photolysis). In view of these observations, the probability of photobleaching,
                  pb, as well as a closed expression of its dependence on the CW excitation irradiance considering a five-level molecular electronic
                  state model with the possibility of photobleaching from higher excited electronic states, is derived. From this model, optimal
                  conditions for SMD with respect to the number of emitted fluorescence photons and to the signal-to-background ratio are discussed,
                  taking into account both saturation and photobleaching. The additional photobleaching due to two-step photolysis limits the
                  applicable irradiance.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_identification_kne00">A method has been developed for highly sensitive detection of specific DNA sequences in a homogeneous assay using labeled
                  oligonucleotide molecules in combination with single-molecule photon burst counting and identification. The fluorescently
                  labeled oligonucleotides are called smart probes because they report the presence of complementary target sequences by a strong
                  increase in fluorescence intensity. The smart probes consist of a fluorescent dye attached at the terminus of a hairpin oligonucleotide.
                  The presented technique takes advantage of the fact that the used oxazine dye JA242 is efficiently quenched by complementary
                  guanosine residues. Upon specific hybridization to the target DNA, the smart probe undergoes a conformational change that
                  forces the fluorescent dye and the guanosine residues apart, thereby increasing the fluorescence intensity about six fold
                  in ensemble measurements. To increase the detection sensitivity below the nanomolar range, a confocal fluorescence microscope
                  was used to observe the fluorescence bursts from individual smart probes in the presence and absence of target DNA as they
                  passed through the focused laser beam. Smart probes were excited by a pulsed diode laser emitting at 635 nm with a repetition
                  rate of 64 MHz. Each fluorescence burst was identified by three independent parameters: (a) the burst size, (b) the burst
                  duration, and (c) the fluorescence lifetime. Through the use of this multiparameter analysis, higher discrimination accuracies
                  between smart probes and hybridized probe-target duplexes were achieved. The presented multiparameter detection technique
                  permits the identification of picomolar target DNA concentrations in a homogeneous assay, i.e., the detection of specific
                  DNA sequences in a 200-fold excess of labeled probe molecules.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_iminobiotin_bay86">A new method for the preparation of a more efficient, stable iminobiotin-containing resin for the isolation of streptavidin
                  was developed. CL-Sepharose was activated with p-nitrophenyl chloroformate, and the resultant carbonate derivative was reacted
                  with diaminohexane. Subsequent reaction of the amino-containing resin with iminobiotin-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (in an organic
                  solvent) yielded the stable affinity resin. The capacity of this resin for either avidin of streptavidin was 12 mg per ml
                  resin, and streptavidin could be purified in one step directly from the culture broth of Streptomyces avidinii. The biotin-binding
                  protein isolated in this manner exhibited a major band at about 75 kDa and a minor band at about 150 kDa. Under denaturing
                  conditions, a spectrum of subunit molecular weights ranging between 15 and 19 kDa was detected, the distributiob of which
                  depended upon the specific preparation.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_immunocytochemistry_hai00">Recent advances in gold technology have led to probes with improved properties and performance for cell biologists: higher
                  labeling density, better sensitivity, and greater penetration into tissues. Gold clusters, such as the 1.4-nm Nanogold, are
                  gold compounds that can be covalently linked to Fab' antibody fragments, making small and stable probes. Silver enhancement
                  then makes these small gold particles easily visible by EM, LM, and directly by eye. Another advance is the combination of
                  fluorescent and gold probes for correlative microscopy. Chemical crosslinking of gold particles to many biologically active
                  molecules has made possible many novel probes, such as gold?lipids, gold?Ni?NTA, and gold?ATP.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_immunogold_hai00">Recent advances in gold technology have led to probes with improved properties and performance for cell biologists: higher
                  labeling density, better sensitivity, and greater penetration into tissues. Gold clusters, such as the 1.4-nm Nanogold, are
                  gold compounds that can be covalently linked to Fab' antibody fragments, making small and stable probes. Silver enhancement
                  then makes these small gold particles easily visible by EM, LM, and directly by eye. Another advance is the combination of
                  fluorescent and gold probes for correlative microscopy. Chemical crosslinking of gold particles to many biologically active
                  molecules has made possible many novel probes, such as gold?lipids, gold?Ni?NTA, and gold?ATP.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none"
                  id="abstract_increased_photostabilities_ged03a">Substantial increases in fluorescence emission from fluorophore-protein-coated fractal-like silver structures have been observed.
                  We review two methods for silver fractal structure preparation, which have been employed and studied. The first, a roughened
                  silver electrode, typically yielded a 100-fold increase in fluorophore emission, and the second, silver fractal-like structures
                  grown on glass between two silver electrodes, produced a [ap]500-fold increase. In addition, significant increases in probe
                  photostability were observed for probes coated on the silver fractal like structures. These results further serve to compliment
                  our recent work on the effects of nobel metal particles with fluorophores, a relatively new phenomenon in fluorescence we
                  have termed both 'metal-enhanced fluorescence' [1] and 'radiative decay engineering' [2,3]. These results are explained by
                  the metallic surfaces modifying the radiative decay rate ([Gamma]) of the fluorescent labels. We believe that this new silver-surface
                  preparation, which results in ultrabright and photostable fluorophores, offers a new generic technology platform for increased
                  fluorescence signal levels, with widespread potential applications to the analytical sciences, imaging, and medical diagnostics.

                  phenomenon in fluorescence. We subsequently examined indocyanine green (ICG), which is widely used in medical testing and
                  imaging, in close proximity to an electrically roughened platinum electrode. The emission intensity and lifetimes were decreased
                  about 2-fold on the roughened surface as compared to a smooth Pt surface, and the photostability about the same. Platinum
                  does not appear promising for metal enhanced fluorescence, at least for long wavelength fluorophores.

                  id="abstract_induced_fluorescence_detection_che04">For the first time, an aqueous solution of 32-nm gold nanoparticles (GNPs), to which Nile red (NR) has been noncovalently
                  adsorbed, has been used for sensing thiols. The as-prepared NRGNPs fluoresce weakly as a result of fluorescence resonance
                  energy transfer between NR and the GNPs. The fluorescence of a solution containing NRGNPs at pH 4.0 increases upon the addition
                  of thiols, but not when amines, acids, alcohols, bovine serum albumin, or hemoglobin are added. This phenomenon allows for
                  the selective determination of thiols such as cysteamine and homocysteine, which have limits of detection of 10.2 and 10.9
                  nM, respectively, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. Interestingly, we have found that the excitation (ex = 480 nm), emission
                  (em = 610 nm), and mass spectra (m/z 282) of the substance that desorbs from the GNPs in the presence of thiols are different
                  from those of NR (ex = 580 nm; em = 652 nm; m/z 318), which indicates that a new product forms. When simultaneously conducting
                  fluorescence and colorimetric assays, the selectivity of this approach further improves because at pH 4.0, the color of the
                  NRGNPs does not change in the presence of negatively charged thiols, (e.g., N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine), but changes from
                  maroon to purple and lavender in the presence of neutral thiols (e.g., 3-mercapto-1,2-propanediol) and positively charged
                  thiols (e.g., cysteamine), respectively, as a result of aggregation. This feature allows the types of thiols to be determined
                  at concentrations &gt;1.0 and 0.1 ÂµM by the naked eye and by UV-vis absorption, respectively. Depending on the rate at which
                  the NRGNP color changes, reduced glutathione (slow) is readily distinguishable from oxidized glutathione (no aggregation and
                  no displacement) and from cysteine and homocysteine (fast).

                  inside and outside a stratified sphere consisting of concentric spherical shells. There is no limitation on the dipole position,
                  the number of the concentric shells, the shell medium, or on the sphere radius. Electromagnetic fields are determined anywhere
                  in the space, the time-averaged angular distribution of the radiated power, the total radiated power, Ohmic losses due to
                  an absorbing shell, and Green?s function are calculated. An absorbing, optically active, and ultrathin (less, approximate10
                  nm) metallic shell (core), characterized by a nonlocal dielectric function, are all allowed. The classical results are then
                  applied to inelastic light scattering (fluorescence and Raman), the radiative and nonradiative normalized decay rates, and
                  frequency shift. Using correspondence principle, the radiative decay rate is calculated from the Poynting vector, whereas
                  the nonradiative decay rate is calculated from the Ohmic losses inside a sphere absorptive shell. Numerical stability of our
                  method and limitations of classical description of decay rates are addressed. The importance of grouping various radiative
                  and nonradiative decay mechanisms into local and nonlocal decay rates is emphasized. Further possible extensions of the theory
                  presented here to the case of an arbitrary multilayered (axially symmetric) particle and to the classical problem of a radiating
                  quadrupole in the presence of a multilayered particle are briefly outlined. Various applications for chemical speciation,
                  LIDAR, fluorescent microscopy, engineering of decay rates, identification of biological particles, and monitoring specific
                  cell functions are envisaged. Computer program is freely available at http://www.wave-scattering.com.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_infrared_grd02">The secondary structure of bovine serum albumin (BSA) is determined from infrared spectra (cast films, solution in phosphate
                  buffer) by analyzing the structure of Amide bands. Due to strong overlapping of intrinsic bands three classical methods of
                  band decomposition was implemented: Fourier self deconvolution, second derivatives and band fitting algorithm. The initial
                  values for the number of the components and their position was checked with a novel procedure of dry and hydrated H/D exchange.
                  The most dominant band component in Amide I region is the band at 1654 cm-1, which is usually attributed to a-helical structure.
                  Other bands in Amide I region are attributed to various type of turns. Hydration of protein, as well as the solvation of protein
                  in phosphate buffer, induces the radical change in the secondary structure, especially in the population of a-helices. Drying
                  of the protein film causes a partial denaturation. Classical methods for determine the changes in secondary structure are
                  not accurate enough. Moreover, the interpretation of changes can be easily misleading. Hence, the difference spectroscopy
                  was used to clarify the effects of hydration and solvation on the protein secondary structure. The solvated protein was measured
                  in ATR cell. For proper compare the ATR spectrum with the normal transmission one, first optical constant n and k were calculated
                  and later the exact absorption spectrum.

                  a metal particle of complex shape and, possibly, in the presence of a solvent. The molecule is treated quantum mechanically
                  at Hartree?Fock (HF) or density-functional theory (DFT) level. The metal/solvent is considered as a continuous body, characterized
                  by its frequency dependent local dielectric constant. For simple metal shapes (planar infinite surface and spherical particle)
                  a version of the polarizable continuum model based on the integral equation formalism has been used, while an alternative
                  methodology has been implemented to treat metal particles of arbitrary shape. In both cases, equations have been numerically
                  solved using a boundary element method. Excitation energies and nonradiative decay rates due to the energy transfer from the
                  molecule to the metal are evaluated exploiting the linear response theory (TDHF or TDDFT where TD?time dependent). The radiative
                  decay rate of the whole system (molecule+metal/solvent) is calculated, still using a continuum model, in terms of the response
                  of the surrounding to the molecular transition. The model presented has been applied to the study of the radiative and nonradiative
                  lifetimes of a lissamine molecule in solution (water) and close to gold spherical nanoparticles of different radius. In addition,
                  the influence of the metal shape has been analyzed by performing calculations on a system composed by a coumarin-type molecule
                  close to silver aggregates of complex shape.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_integral_equations_cor03">We present a model for the evaluation of the metal-induced deexcitation rate for molecules close to a metal surface. In this
                  model, the molecule is treated quantum mechanically at the density-functional theory level and its excitations with a time-dependent
                  density-functional theory procedure. The metal is described through its dielectric response properties. The nonlocal features
                  of such a response are taken into account by using a modified Lindhard-Mermin dielectric constant. The presence of small random
                  roughness on the metal surface is described with the model of Rahman and Maradudin [Phys. Rev. B 21, 504 (1980)]. Systems
                  in which the molecule close to the metal is immersed in an homogeneous matrix or deposited on a spacer are considered. The
                  matrix and the spacer are treated with the polarizable continuum model. The molecule-metal and the molecule-matrix (or molecule-spacer)
                  electrostatic interactions are described by using the integral equation formalism, numerically treated with a boundary element
                  method. As a test case, the method has been applied to the study of phosphorescence from biacetyl close to a silver surface
                  and immersed in or deposited on solid ammonia. Our results show that nonlocal metal response and surface roughness have an
                  important role in explaining measured lifetimes.

                  frequency and of the physical properties of the host particle. The rates are found to range from about 0.2 to more than 1500

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_island_films_gou05">In this paper, the fabrication, characterization, and application of unique layer-by-layer (LBL) films of dendrimers and metallic
                  nanoparticles is reported. Silver nanoparticles (d = Â 20 nm) are produced in solution by sodium citrate reduction and incorporated
                  into thin films with generation 1 and 5 DAB-Am dendrimers (polypropylenimine dendrimers with amino surface groups) by the
                  LBL technique. The resulting nanocomposite films are characterized by UV-visible surface plasmon absorption and atomic force
                  microscopy (AFM) measurements, and employed as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of 2-naphthalenethiol.
                  Through variation of the molecular size (dendrimer generation) and concentration of the cross-linker used, as well as the
                  number of layers produced, the optical properties of several different possible architectures are studied. In the films, Ag
                  nanoparticles are shown to be effectively immobilized and stabilized with increased control over their spacing and aggregation.
                  Moreover, the films are shown to be excellent substrates for SERS measurements, demonstrating significant enhancement capability.
                  As expected, large electromagnetic enhancement of Raman scattering signals is found to be strongly dependent on interparticle
                  coupling between neighboring metallic nanoparticles. Finally, the possibility of detecting SERS signals from architectures
                  with intervening layers between the metal nanoparticles and analyte molecules is explored. It is shown that although there
                  are decreases in intensity with increasing number of intervening layers (as is expected from the distance dependence of SERS),
                  electromagnetic enhancement is still able to function at these distances, thus offering the possibility of developing sensors
                  with external layers that are chemically selective for specific analytes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_labeled_antibodies_ben05">Membrane topology of receptors plays an important role in shaping transmembrane signalling of cells. Among the methods used
                  for characterizing receptor clusters, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a donor and acceptor fluorophore plays
                  a unique role based on its capability of detecting molecular level (2-10 nm) proximities of receptors in physiological conditions.
                  Recent development of biotechnology has made possible the usage of colloidal gold particles in a large size range for specific
                  labelling of cells for the purposes of electron microscopy. However, by combining metal and fluorophore labelling or cells,
                  the versatility of metal-fluorophore interactions opens the way for new applications by detecting the presence of the metal
                  particles by the methods of fluorescence spectroscopy. An outstanding feature of the metal nanoparticle-fluorophore interaction
                  is that the metal particle can enhance spontaneous emission of the fluorophore in a distance-dependent fashion, in an interaction
                  range esentially determined by the size of the nanoparticle. In our work enhanced fluorescence of rhodamine and cyanine dyes
                  was observed in the vicinity of immunogold nanoparticles on the surface of JY cells in a flow cytometer. The dyes and the
                  immunogold were targetted to the cell surface receptors MHCI, MHCII, transferrin receptor and CD45 by monoclonal antibodies.
                  The fluorescence enhancement was sensitive to the wavelength of the exciting light, the size and amount of surface bound gold
                  beads, as well as the fluorophore-nanoparticle distance. The intensity of 90&amp;DEG; scattering of the incident light beam was
                  enhanced by the immunogold in a concentration and size-dependent fashion. The 90&amp;DEG; light scattering varied with the wavelength
                  of the incident light in a manner characteristic to gold nanoparticles of the applied sizes. A reduction in photobleaching
                  time constant of the cyanine dye was observed in the vicinity of gold particles in a digital imaging microscope. Modulations
                  of 90&amp;DEG; light scattering intensity and photobleaching time constant indicate the role of the local field in the fluorescence
                  enhancement. A mathematical simulation based on the electrodynamic theory of fluorescence enhancement showed a consistency
                  between the measured enhancement values, the inter-epitope distances and the quantum yields. The feasibility of realizing
                  proximity sensors operating at distance ranges larger than that of the conventional Forster transfer is demonstrated on the
                  surface of living cells. Copyright &amp;COPY; 2004 John Wiley&amp; Sons, Ltd.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none"
                  id="abstract_langmuir_blodgett_monolayers_gou05">In this paper, the fabrication, characterization, and application of unique layer-by-layer (LBL) films of dendrimers and metallic
                  nanoparticles is reported. Silver nanoparticles (d = Â 20 nm) are produced in solution by sodium citrate reduction and incorporated
                  into thin films with generation 1 and 5 DAB-Am dendrimers (polypropylenimine dendrimers with amino surface groups) by the
                  LBL technique. The resulting nanocomposite films are characterized by UV-visible surface plasmon absorption and atomic force
                  microscopy (AFM) measurements, and employed as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of 2-naphthalenethiol.
                  Through variation of the molecular size (dendrimer generation) and concentration of the cross-linker used, as well as the
                  number of layers produced, the optical properties of several different possible architectures are studied. In the films, Ag
                  nanoparticles are shown to be effectively immobilized and stabilized with increased control over their spacing and aggregation.
                  Moreover, the films are shown to be excellent substrates for SERS measurements, demonstrating significant enhancement capability.
                  As expected, large electromagnetic enhancement of Raman scattering signals is found to be strongly dependent on interparticle
                  coupling between neighboring metallic nanoparticles. Finally, the possibility of detecting SERS signals from architectures
                  with intervening layers between the metal nanoparticles and analyte molecules is explored. It is shown that although there
                  are decreases in intensity with increasing number of intervening layers (as is expected from the distance dependence of SERS),
                  electromagnetic enhancement is still able to function at these distances, thus offering the possibility of developing sensors
                  with external layers that are chemically selective for specific analytes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_laser_beam_effects_ang06">We present an experimental and theoretical study of the fluorescence rate of a single molecule as a function of its distance
                  to a laser-irradiated gold nanoparticle. The local field enhancement leads to an increased excitation rate whereas nonradiative
                  energy transfer to the particle leads to a decrease of the quantum yield (quenching). Because of these competing effects,
                  previous experiments showed either fluorescence enhancement or fluorescence quenching. By varying the distance between molecule
                  and particle we show the first experimental measurement demonstrating the continuous transition from fluorescence enhancement
                  to fluorescence quenching. This transition cannot be explained by treating the particle as a polarizable sphere in the dipole
                  approximation.

                  as a near-field probe. This microscope is suitable for observations of biological specimens in aqueous solutions because the
                  probe particle is held by a noncontact force exerted by a laser beam. Theoretical calculations based on Mie scattering theory
                  are presented to evaluate the near-field enhancement by a gold particle of 40 nm diameter. We also present fluorescence images
                  of a single fluorescent bead and discuss the near-field contribution to the fluorescence image in this type of microscope.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_lifetime_liv85">In this work we shall develop a formalism which extends previous calculations of lifetimes of excited molecular states near
                  planar dielectric surfaces and near single small dielectric particles to situations where the molecule is adsorbed on a cluster
                  made of several dielectric spherical grains. The nonradiative relaxation rate is seen to be relatively weakly dependent on
                  the cluster structure and, if the molecule is adsorbed on one of the grains, is well approximated by the single grain result.
                  The radiative decay rate and hence the quantum yield are much more sensitive to the geometry of the cluster which determines
                  the position (in frequency) of the dielectric resonances of the cluster. The formalism developed here may be used to evaluate
                  local field intensities at different positions within a cluster of dielectric grains under the influence of an external incident

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_lifetime_rup82">The decay of an excited molecule near a small metal sphere is considered from the viewpoint of electromagnetic theory. The
                  total decay rate of the emitting dipole is obtained by considering the two mechanisms through which energy is dissipated.
                  One is the radiative loss, which is calculated from the Poynting vector, and the other is the nonradiative decay which is
                  calculated from the Ohmic losses inside the sphere. Numerical computations are performed for the case of a molecule near a
                  small silver sphere, and the results are compared with those for a molecule near the planar boundary of a silver half-space.

                  nanoparticles in N,N-dimethylformamide. The formation of particle aggregates was observed upon mixing the particle solution
                  with the complex solution, in which the complexes behaved like linker molecules. Luminescent intensity of the complexes was
                  enhanced in the presence of silver nanoparticles, but at only a limited particle concentration region. The observed particle
                  concentration dependences of the luminescent intensity were regarded as the result of a delicate balance between an enhancing
                  and a quenching effect of the silver nanoparticles. In addition to the change in intensity, silver nanoparticles also affected
                  the asymmetric ratio (or monochromaticity) of the europium luminescence. These changes in the luminescent properties of the
                  complex were discussed in terms of the effects of particle aggregates and consequent modifications of the local electromagnetic
                  field, refractive index, and the ligand field around europium ion.

                  particle-particle and tip-sample interactions. In this perspective, we investigate theoretically, at a very moderate level
                  of sophistication, the optical behavior of simple silver nanoparticle aggregates, in terms of a formalism involving a multipolar
                  expansion of the fields involved, along with a simplified model for the optical behavior of nanostructures previously developed.
                  In particular, the tip-sample interaction is taken into account roughly, treating the tip as an additional, single particle,
                  characterized by proper dielectric behavior.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_light_absorption_bra05">We extend the plasmon hybridization method to investigate the plasmon modes of metallic nanoshell dimers. The formalism is
                  also generalized to include the effects of dielectric backgrounds. It is shown that the presence of dielectrics shifts the
                  plasmon resonances of the individual nanoparticles to lower energies and screens their interaction in the dimer configuration.
                  The net result is a redshift of dimer energies compared to the system without dielectrics and a weaker dependence of the dimer
                  plasmon energies on dimer separation. We calculate the plasmon energies and optical absorption of nanoshell dimers as a function
                  of dimer separation. The results are in excellent agreement with the results of finite difference time domain simulations.

                  an electro-optical material such as a liquid crystal in order to induce a spectral shift of the particle plasmon resonance
                  by applying an electric field. Light scattering experiments on single gold nanoparticles show that spherically shaped nanoparticles
                  become optically spheroidal when covered by an anisotropic liquid crystal. The two particle plasmon resonances of the optically

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_light_scattering_soe00">We have developed a simple, fast, and flexible technique to measure optical scattering spectra of individual metallic nanoparticles.
                  The particles are placed in an evanescent field produced by total internal reflection of light from a halogen lamp in a glass
                  prism. The light scattered by individual particles is collected using a conventional microscope and is spectrally analyzed
                  by a nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled-device array coupled to a spectrometer. This technique is employed to measure the effect
                  of particle diameter on the dephasing time of the particle plasmon resonance in gold nanoparticles. We also demonstrate the
                  use of this technique for measurements in liquids, which is important for the potential application of particle plasmons in
                  chemical or biological nanosensors.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_light_scattering_wei83">The enhancements of normal Raman scattering, resonance Raman scattering, and fluorescence from molecules adsorbed on identical,
                  well-characterized, silver-island films are reported. The enhancement arises from the electromagnetic interaction between
                  the molecules and the electronic plasma resonance of the silver islands. A hierarchy of enhancement ratios is found, with
                  typical values of 105 for RS, 103 for RRS and 10?1 to 10 for fluorescence, depending on the quantum yield of the molecular
                  fluorescence. A model, developed on heuristic grounds and substantiated using the density matrix formalism, describes the
                  light scattering processes and the effects of the plasma resonance. This model presents a unified picture of the surface-induced
                  enhancement effects and is consistent with the experimental values. The comparison of all the forms of optical scattering
                  leads to a complete determination of the role of the plasma resonances in the various portions of the scattering process.
                  The excitation of the electronic plasma resonance results in an increased local field at the molecules leading to an increased
                  excitation or absorption rate. Similarly, the excitation of the plasma resonance by the molecular emission dipole results
                  in an increase in the radiative decay rate. However, the electromagnetic coupling of the molecule to the plasma resonance
                  also adds an additional damping channel which can result in a reduction of the absorption or excitation rate as well as the
                  emission yield. The resultant balance of these processes leads to the hierarchy in the measured enhancements. The hierarchy
                  of enhancements is also shown to have important spectroscopic consequences.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_light_scattering_sey05">Efforts to improve the performance of immunoassays and immunosensors by incorporating different kinds of nanostructures have
                  gained considerable momentum over the last decade. Apart from liposomes, which will not be discussed here, most groups focus
                  on artificial, particulate marker systems, both organic and inorganic. The underlying detection procedures may be based either
                  on electro-magnetical or optical techniques. This review will be confined to the latter only, comprising nanoparticle applications
                  generating signals as diverse as static and time-resolved luminescence, one- and two-photon absorption, Raman and Rayleigh
                  scattering as well as surface plasmon resonance and others. In general, all endeavors cited are geared to achieve one or more
                  of the following goals: lowering of detection limits (if possible, down to single-molecule level), parallel integration of
                  multiple signals (multiplexing), signal amplification by several orders of magnitude and prevention of photobleaching effects
                  with concomitant maintenance of antigen binding specificity and sensitivity. Inorganic nanoparticle labels based on noble
                  metals, semiconductor quantum dots and nanoshells appear to be the most versatile systems for these bioanalytical applications
                  of nanophotonics. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_light_scattering_son05">Forster Resonance Energy Transfer has served as a molecular ruler that reports conformational changes and intramolecular distances
                  of single biomolecules(1-4). However, such rulers suffer from low and fluctuating signal intensities, limited observation
                  time due to photobleaching, and an upper distance limit of similar to 10 nm. Noble metal nanoparticles have plasmon resonances
                  in the visible range and do not blink or bleach. They have been employed as alternative probes to overcome the limitations
                  of organic fluorophores(5,6), and the coupling of plasmons in nearby particles has been exploited to detect particle aggregation
                  by a distinct color change in bulk experiments(7-9). Here we demonstrate that plasmon coupling can be used to monitor distances
                  between single pairs of gold and silver nanoparticles. We followed the directed assembly of gold and silver nanoparticle dimers
                  in real time and studied the kinetics of single DNA hybridization events. These 'plasmon rulers' allowed us to continuously
                  monitor separations of up to 70 nm for &gt;3,000 s.

                  id="abstract_lipid_bilayer_vesicles_bar05">Excited-state interactions between chlorophyll a (Chla) and gold nanoparticles have been studied. The emission intensity of
                  Chla is quenched by gold nanoparticles. The dominant process for this quenching has been attributed to the process of photoinduced
                  electron transfer from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, although because of a small overlap between fluorescence of Chla
                  and absorption of gold nanoparticles, the energy-transfer process cannot be ruled out. Photoinduced electron-transfer mechanism
                  is supported by the electrochemical modulation of fluorescence of Chla. In absence of an applied bias, Chla cast on gold film,
                  as a result of electron transfer, exhibits a very weak fluorescence. However, upon negatively charging the gold nanocore by
                  external bias, an increase in fluorescence intensity is observed. The negatively charged gold nanoparticles create a barrier
                  and suppress the electron-transfer process from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, resulting in an increase in radiative
                  process. Nanosecond laser flash experiments of Chla in the presence of gold nanoparticles and fullerene (C-60) have demonstrated
                  that Au nanoparticles, besides accepting electrons, can also mediate or shuttle electrons to another acceptor. Taking advantage
                  of these properties of gold nanoparticles, a photoelectrochemical cell based on Chla and gold nanoparticles is constructed.
                  A superior performance of this cell compared to that without the gold film is due to the beneficial role of gold nanoparticles
                  in accepting and shuttling the photogenerated electrons in Chla to the collecting electrode, leading to an enhancement in
                  charge separation efficiency.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_lipid_rafts_ben05">Membrane topology of receptors plays an important role in shaping transmembrane signalling of cells. Among the methods used
                  for characterizing receptor clusters, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a donor and acceptor fluorophore plays
                  a unique role based on its capability of detecting molecular level (2-10 nm) proximities of receptors in physiological conditions.
                  Recent development of biotechnology has made possible the usage of colloidal gold particles in a large size range for specific
                  labelling of cells for the purposes of electron microscopy. However, by combining metal and fluorophore labelling or cells,
                  the versatility of metal-fluorophore interactions opens the way for new applications by detecting the presence of the metal
                  particles by the methods of fluorescence spectroscopy. An outstanding feature of the metal nanoparticle-fluorophore interaction
                  is that the metal particle can enhance spontaneous emission of the fluorophore in a distance-dependent fashion, in an interaction
                  range esentially determined by the size of the nanoparticle. In our work enhanced fluorescence of rhodamine and cyanine dyes
                  was observed in the vicinity of immunogold nanoparticles on the surface of JY cells in a flow cytometer. The dyes and the
                  immunogold were targetted to the cell surface receptors MHCI, MHCII, transferrin receptor and CD45 by monoclonal antibodies.
                  The fluorescence enhancement was sensitive to the wavelength of the exciting light, the size and amount of surface bound gold
                  beads, as well as the fluorophore-nanoparticle distance. The intensity of 90&amp;DEG; scattering of the incident light beam was
                  enhanced by the immunogold in a concentration and size-dependent fashion. The 90&amp;DEG; light scattering varied with the wavelength
                  of the incident light in a manner characteristic to gold nanoparticles of the applied sizes. A reduction in photobleaching
                  time constant of the cyanine dye was observed in the vicinity of gold particles in a digital imaging microscope. Modulations
                  of 90&amp;DEG; light scattering intensity and photobleaching time constant indicate the role of the local field in the fluorescence
                  enhancement. A mathematical simulation based on the electrodynamic theory of fluorescence enhancement showed a consistency
                  between the measured enhancement values, the inter-epitope distances and the quantum yields. The feasibility of realizing
                  proximity sensors operating at distance ranges larger than that of the conventional Forster transfer is demonstrated on the
                  surface of living cells. Copyright &amp;COPY; 2004 John Wiley&amp; Sons, Ltd.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_lithography_str05">In this work we report on the so-called plasmonic enhancement effect, whereby the presence of metallic surfaces or particles
                  in the vicinity of a fluorophore can dramatically alter the fluorescence emission and absorption properties of a fluorophore.
                  The effect, which is associated with the surface plasmon resonance of the metallic surface, depends on parameters such as
                  metal type, particle size, fluorophore type, and fluorophore-particle separation. This work focuses on the creation of metal
                  nanoparticle arrays by a lithographic process and on optimisation strategies to maximise the fluorescence enhancement of dyes
                  in the vicinity of the nanoparticles, for important applications such as fluorescence-based biochip platforms. Ordered arrays
                  of metallic nano-islands were fabricated on glass substrates by a process of natural lithography using monodisperse polystyrene
                  nanospheres. The metal particle dimensions were tailored in order to tune the plasmon resonance wavelength to match the spectral
                  absorption of the fluorophore. The fluorophore, Cy5 dye, which is widely used in optical immunoassays and has a medium quantum
                  efficiency (similar to 0.3), was used in this preliminary study of the plasmonic enhancement effect. The morphology of the
                  metallic arrays was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Absorption and
                  emission spectroscopies were used to elucidate the enhancement effect and its dependence on metal island morphology. Results
                  were correlated with existing theoretical models. The applicability of this important technique to sensor platforms, such
                  as fluorescence-based biochips, is also discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_luminescence_mer07">We present a theoretical study of the modifications of the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of an optical emitter in
                  close proximity to a noble-metal nanosphere, based on exact electrodynamical theory. We show that the optimal nanosphere diameter
                  for luminescence quantum efficiency enhancement associated with resonant coupling to plasmon modes is in the range of 30-110
                  nm, depending on the material properties. The optimal diameter is found to be a trade-off between (1) emitter-plasmon coupling,
                  which is most effective for small spheres, and (2) the outcoupling of plasmons into radiation, which is most efficient for
                  large spheres. In addition, we show that the well-known Gersten and Nitzan model does not describe the existence of a finite
                  optimal diameter unless the model is extended with the correction factor for radiation damping. With this correction and a
                  correction for dynamic depolarization, the mathematically simpler Gersten and Nitzan model provides a reasonably accurate
                  approximation of the decay rate modifications associated with coupling to the dipole plasmon mode. We anticipate that the
                  Gersten and Nitzan model in the form that we validate in this paper for spheres will allow the analytical investigation of
                  the influence of shape anisotropy on plasmon-enhanced luminescence.

                  by using different mole ratios of silver nitrate/tiopronin. Ligands on the silver particles were partially displaced by fluorescein-labeled
                  thiolate single-stranded oligonucleotides or their complementary unlabeled oligonucleotides through ligand exchange. The fluorophores
                  on silver particles showed a surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF) dependent on the size of metallic cores. The particles could
                  be coupled through hybridizations of oligonucleotides bound on the particles. The coupled particles were aggregated due to
                  multiple displacements of oligonucleotides on each particle, resulting in stronger SEF. The dye-labeled oligonucleotides were
                  assembled on the silver islands on the solid substrate, and the complementary oligonucleotide-displaced particles were coupled
                  via oligonucleotide hybridization. The couplings between particles and islands resulted in an obvious fluorescence enhancement.

                  colloid containing Dy3+ were measured. For solution containing Dy3+, fluorescence emission occurs at visible light wavelength
                  region. Two emission peaks are observed at 480 nm and 570 nm respectively when the corresponding excitation wavelength is
                  at 350 nm. When An colloids were added to the solution containing Dy3+, both these two fluorescence peaks were enhanced. Furthermore,
                  with the increasing Au content, the fluorescence increases first and then decreases. We believe that this increased fluorescence
                  are due to the local field enhancement around Dy3+ ions owing to the induced higher orders of surface plasmon resonance. (c)

                  id="abstract_luminescent_quantum_dots_sey05">Efforts to improve the performance of immunoassays and immunosensors by incorporating different kinds of nanostructures have
                  gained considerable momentum over the last decade. Apart from liposomes, which will not be discussed here, most groups focus
                  on artificial, particulate marker systems, both organic and inorganic. The underlying detection procedures may be based either
                  on electro-magnetical or optical techniques. This review will be confined to the latter only, comprising nanoparticle applications
                  generating signals as diverse as static and time-resolved luminescence, one- and two-photon absorption, Raman and Rayleigh
                  scattering as well as surface plasmon resonance and others. In general, all endeavors cited are geared to achieve one or more
                  of the following goals: lowering of detection limits (if possible, down to single-molecule level), parallel integration of
                  multiple signals (multiplexing), signal amplification by several orders of magnitude and prevention of photobleaching effects
                  with concomitant maintenance of antigen binding specificity and sensitivity. Inorganic nanoparticle labels based on noble
                  metals, semiconductor quantum dots and nanoshells appear to be the most versatile systems for these bioanalytical applications
                  of nanophotonics. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

                  is improved significantly, due to a dramatic decrease of the fluorescence lifetime caused by the strong electromagnetic interaction
                  between the emitting molecule and the metal layer. Moreover, the metal shell enhances the exciting electric field intensity

                  The fraction of Rtt(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) that is in solution can be distinguished from the surface-bound fraction
                  by the relative lifetimes and integrated emission yields as determined by time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) spectroscopy.
                  Complementary steady-state measurements were carried out to confirm surface attachment of the phosphorescent label molecules.
                  Although the emission of solutions of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) is quenched proportional to the concentration of 10
                  nm Au or 20 nm Ag nanoparticles, the quenching is static and not diffusional quenching observed in Stern-Volmer plots. The
                  results demonstrate that time-resolved spectroscopy provides a rapid method for the measurement of surface binding of labeled
                  molecules on metallic nanoparticles. While steady-state measurements require the preparation of a series of samples with varying
                  quencher concentrations and a reference, the method described herein requires a single sample plus reference. The mechanism
                  for phosphorescence quenching on Au and Ag nanoparticles is discussed in terms of energy and electron transfer theories.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_metal_nanoparticles_asl05">Gold colloids are well known to display strong plasmon absorption bands due to electron oscillations induced by the incident
                  light. When the colloids are in proximity, the plasmon absorption bands are often perturbed. This has enabled us recently
                  to successfully develop a glucose sensing platform based on the disassociation of dextrancoated gold colloids, cross-linked
                  with Con A, by glucose. However, a much more useful and simpler property of gold colloids, which has been ill explored with
                  regard to sensing, is their ability to efficiently scatter excitation fight. We have found that our nanogold sensing aggregates
                  are indeed efficient light scatters around the nanogold plasmon absorption band. By measuring the ratio of scattered fight
                  intensities at two different arbitrary wavelengths, 560 and 680 nm, glucose concentrations can be readily determined from
                  a few millimolar up to similar to 60 mM, using a simple white light LED and detection system. Further, by measuring the ratio
                  of the scattered intensities, this sensing approach is independent of the total sensing aggregate concentration and the excitation
                  and detection instrumentation fluctuations or drifts. This simplistic and low-cost approach to glucose sensing, coupled with
                  the sensing aggreagates' ability to scatter red light, suggests the potential use of these aggregates for use in physiological
                  transdermal glucose monitoring, either for implantable skin sensors or glucose sensing tattoos (discussed later).

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_metal_nanoparticles_bar05">Excited-state interactions between chlorophyll a (Chla) and gold nanoparticles have been studied. The emission intensity of
                  Chla is quenched by gold nanoparticles. The dominant process for this quenching has been attributed to the process of photoinduced
                  electron transfer from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, although because of a small overlap between fluorescence of Chla
                  and absorption of gold nanoparticles, the energy-transfer process cannot be ruled out. Photoinduced electron-transfer mechanism
                  is supported by the electrochemical modulation of fluorescence of Chla. In absence of an applied bias, Chla cast on gold film,
                  as a result of electron transfer, exhibits a very weak fluorescence. However, upon negatively charging the gold nanocore by
                  external bias, an increase in fluorescence intensity is observed. The negatively charged gold nanoparticles create a barrier
                  and suppress the electron-transfer process from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, resulting in an increase in radiative
                  process. Nanosecond laser flash experiments of Chla in the presence of gold nanoparticles and fullerene (C-60) have demonstrated
                  that Au nanoparticles, besides accepting electrons, can also mediate or shuttle electrons to another acceptor. Taking advantage
                  of these properties of gold nanoparticles, a photoelectrochemical cell based on Chla and gold nanoparticles is constructed.
                  A superior performance of this cell compared to that without the gold film is due to the beneficial role of gold nanoparticles
                  in accepting and shuttling the photogenerated electrons in Chla to the collecting electrode, leading to an enhancement in
                  charge separation efficiency.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_metal_nanoparticles_mar05">With respect to the origin of single-molecule sensitivity in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), elastic scattering
                  and emission spectra were studied for Ag particles adsorbed with dye or adenine molecules. The scattering peak observed at
                  600-650 nm was extinguished during the inactivation process of the enormous SERS signal, whereas localized surface plasmon
                  (LSP) peaks located at 520 and 730 nm did not change significantly. It was found using a numerical simulation that the additional
                  scattering peak arises from increased electromagnetic coupling between the LSP of adjacent Ag particles through dye molecules
                  located at their junction. In addition, two distinct emission peaks were observed at 550-600 and 600-750 nm only for hot Ag
                  particles with adsorbates. Based on the observations for different surface coverages and on different dye species, these bands
                  were attributed to enhanced radiative decay of LSP and fluorescence of molecules, respectively. Interestingly, adenine molecules
                  on the Ag nanoparticles show similar fluorescence peaks at 600-650 nm, suggesting a charge-transfer state upon adsorption.

                  be coupled through hybridizations of oligonucleotides bound on the particles. The coupled particles were aggregated due to
                  multiple displacements of oligonucleotides on each particle, resulting in stronger SEF. The dye-labeled oligonucleotides were
                  assembled on the silver islands on the solid substrate, and the complementary oligonucleotide-displaced particles were coupled
                  via oligonucleotide hybridization. The couplings between particles and islands resulted in an obvious fluorescence enhancement.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_metal_particles_asl04a">Biotinylated gold nanoparticles were prepared by using a two-step surface modification procedure. First, a carboxyl-terminated
                  alkanethiol was chemisorbed onto the surface of gold nanoparticles in the presence of a stabilizing agent. Subsequently, the
                  carboxyl groups were reacted with (+)-biotinyl-3,6,9,-trioxaundecanediamine and 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol. This procedure resulted
                  in stable, ligand-modified gold nanoparticles. Upon interaction with streptavidin, the biotinylated gold nanoparticles aggregated
                  by means of specific biomolecular recognition. Their aggregation was studied by optical absorption spectroscopy. Controlled
                  aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles resulted in a shift in the surface plasmon resonance peak and broadening of
                  the absorption spectrum of the nanoparticles. The spectral changes were used to assess the extent of aggregation. Aggregation
                  was found to be dependent on the concentrations of streptavidin, biotinylated gold nanoparticles, and the surface mole fraction
                  of biotin groups on the nanoparticles. Maximum aggregation was observed when 24 nM streptavidin and 0.80 nM biotinylated gold
                  nanoparticles were used. Reversal of nanoparticle aggregation was accomplished by the addition of soluble biotin to the streptavidin-nanoparticle
                  aggregates. Kinetic analysis of the absorbance data showed that streptavidin-induced aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles
                  could be interpreted in terms of a Reaction-Limited Colloidal Aggregation (RLCA) model. This indicates that optical absorption
                  spectroscopy can provide a quantitative measurement of the aggregation process.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_metal_particles_xux4">It is well known that surface plasmon absorption (color) of Au nanoparticles highly depends on its size, shape, and surrounding
                  surface environment, providing a great opportunity for the development of Au nanoparticles as a probe for chemical and biochemical
                  sensing and as a building block for nano-optical devices. Currently, it remains incompletely understood how the surface properties
                  of Au nanoparticles ultimately define its optical properties, hindering the progress of rational design of Au nanoparticles
                  for biochemical sensing and assembly of nano-optical devices. Ru(bpy)32+ possesses rich photochemical and electrochemical
                  properties, offering a unique probe to study the surface environment of Au nanoparticles. In this study, we investigate the
                  kinetics of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles (6.5, 19, 48, 97 nm) in the presence of Ru(bpy)32+ at 24.0, 33.0,
                  and 51.0 C. We find that the color-change rate of Au nanoparticles is highly sensitive to the amount of Ru(bpy)32+. In addition,
                  the minimum (critical) concentration of Ru(bpy)32+ needed to change the color of Au nanoparticles is highly dependent upon
                  temperature and nanoparticle size. TEM images illustrate that the color-change mechanism of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+
                  highly depends on the size of nanoparticles. Control experiments using NaCl and MgCl2 to replace Ru(bpy)32+ show no color
                  change, suggesting that the color change of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+ is not solely attributable to the salt
                  effect. Other factors, such as adsorption of Ru(bpy)32+ on the Au nanoparticle surface, may be involved. Moreover, in the
                  presence of the critical concentration of Ru(bpy)32+, as temperature increases from 24.0 C to 51.0 C, the color-change rate
                  of 19 nm Au nanoparticles increases 8-fold, whereas the color-change rate of 48 nm Au nanoparticles decreases 3-fold, showing
                  the temperature dependence of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles in the presence of surface adsorbates, Ru(bpy)32+.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_metal_particles_yos04">As optical trapping by a focused laser beam is applied for nanoparticles, multiple particles are grasped in the focal spot
                  and make an assembly. Gold nanoparticles confined in such a submicrometer optical cage show a characteristic extinction spectrum
                  depending on laser power. The spectral change can be induced reversibly and repeatedly by tuning the laser power, demonstrating
                  that the assembly of gold nanoparticles can be controlled by the gradient force. This is attributed to the soft confinement
                  of nanoparticles dressed in electrostatic potential barriers.

                  id="abstract_metal_enhanced_fluorescence_luk04">We observed a strong, more than 16-fold, enhancement of Texas Red-labeled BSA fluorescence emission when deposited on silver
                  colloid coated surfaces (SCCS). The same labeled protein deposited on silver island films (SIFs) showed an approximate 8-fold
                  fluorescence enhancement. The lifetimes of Texas Red-BSA fluorescence are significantly shorter on silvered surfaces than
                  on uncoated quartz substrate indicating a strong change in radiative decay rate of the dyes. We also observed a 36-fold increased
                  brightness of overlabeled fluorescein-HSA deposited on silver colloid coated surface. Stronger enhancement observed for overlabeled
                  Fl-HSA protein indicates that presence of silver particles partially decreased self-quenching. Our results indicate that surfaces
                  coated with silver colloids are valuable substrates for metal-enhanced fluorescence.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_metal_surfaces_ler06">We address in this paper the long debated issue of the possibility of vibrational pumping under Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering
                  (SERS) conditions, both theoretically and experimentally. We revisit with simple theoretical models the mechanisms of vibrational
                  pumping and its relation to heating. This presentation provides a clear classification of the various regimes of heating/
                  pumping, from simple global laser heating to selective pumping of a single vibrational mode. We also propose the possibility
                  of extreme pumping driven by stimulated phonon emission, and we introduce and apply a new experimental technique to study
                  these effects in SERS. Our method relies on correlations between Raman peak parameters, and cross-correlation for two Raman
                  peaks. We find strong evidence for local and dynamical heating, but no convincing evidence for selective pumping under our
                  specific experimental SERS conditions.

                  biology. {T}raditional {F}Ã¶rster resonance energy transfer ({FRET}) is efficient for separation distances up to 100 {\AA}.
                  {W}e report the first successful application of a dipole-surface type energy transfer from a molecular dipole to a nanometal
                  surface that more than doubles the traditional {F}Ã¶rster range (220 {\AA}) and follows a 1/{R}4 distance dependence. {W}e
                  appended a 1.4 nm {A}u cluster to the 5' end of one {DNA} strand as the energy acceptor and a fluorescein ({FAM}) to the 5'
                  end of the complementary strand as the energy donor. {A}nalysis of the energy transfer on {DNA} lengths (15, 20, 30, 60bp),
                  complemented by protein-induced {DNA} bending, provides the basis for fully mapping the extent of this dipole surface type
                  mechanism over its entire usable range (50-250 {\AA}). {F}urther, protein function is fully compatible with these nanometal-{DNA}

                  surface plasmon spectroscopy and studied as a function of interparticle distance, particle size, and number of particles.
                  In agreement with recent theoretical predictions, a red shift of the surface plasmon resonance occurring in two-dimensional
                  arrays was found for lattice spacings below 200 nm. This red shift is associated with a significant broadening of the resonance
                  and is attributed to the onset of near-field interactions. We found that the relative contributions of the long-range and
                  short-range interactions in two-dimensional arrays of particles are fundamentally different to those occurring in individual
                  linear chains.an

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_metals_bra05">We extend the plasmon hybridization method to investigate the plasmon modes of metallic nanoshell dimers. The formalism is
                  also generalized to include the effects of dielectric backgrounds. It is shown that the presence of dielectrics shifts the
                  plasmon resonances of the individual nanoparticles to lower energies and screens their interaction in the dimer configuration.
                  The net result is a redshift of dimer energies compared to the system without dielectrics and a weaker dependence of the dimer
                  plasmon energies on dimer separation. We calculate the plasmon energies and optical absorption of nanoshell dimers as a function
                  of dimer separation. The results are in excellent agreement with the results of finite difference time domain simulations.

                  between the emitting molecule and the metal layer. Moreover, the metal shell enhances the exciting electric field intensity
                  leading to an increase in fluorescence brightness by more than one order of magnitude.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_metals_pus06">We present a microscopic model for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) from molecules adsorbed on small noble-metal nanoparticles.
                  In the absence of direct overlap of molecular orbitals and electronic states in the metal, the main enhancement source is
                  the strong electric field of the surface plasmon resonance in a nanoparticle acting on a molecule near the surface. In small
                  particles, the electromagnetic enhancement is strongly modified by quantum-size effects. We show that, in nanometer-sized
                  particles, SERS magnitude is determined by a competition between several quantum-size effects such as the Landau damping of
                  surface plasmon resonance and reduced screening near the nanoparticle surface. Using time-dependent local density approximation,
                  we calculate spatial distribution of local fields near the surface and enhancement factor for different nanoparticles sizes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_metals_rup82">The decay of an excited molecule near a small metal sphere is considered from the viewpoint of electromagnetic theory. The
                  total decay rate of the emitting dipole is obtained by considering the two mechanisms through which energy is dissipated.
                  One is the radiative loss, which is calculated from the Poynting vector, and the other is the nonradiative decay which is
                  calculated from the Ohmic losses inside the sphere. Numerical computations are performed for the case of a molecule near a
                  small silver sphere, and the results are compared with those for a molecule near the planar boundary of a silver half-space.

                  colloid containing Dy3+ were measured. For solution containing Dy3+, fluorescence emission occurs at visible light wavelength
                  region. Two emission peaks are observed at 480 nm and 570 nm respectively when the corresponding excitation wavelength is
                  at 350 nm. When An colloids were added to the solution containing Dy3+, both these two fluorescence peaks were enhanced. Furthermore,
                  with the increasing Au content, the fluorescence increases first and then decreases. We believe that this increased fluorescence
                  are due to the local field enhancement around Dy3+ ions owing to the induced higher orders of surface plasmon resonance. (c)

                  Two DNA hairpins incorporating portions of the Staphlococcus aureus FemA and mecR methicillin-resistance genes were attached
                  to a gold substrate. Upon exposure to the complement, a Â 26-fold increase in fluorescence intensity was measured corresponding
                  to a 96 Â± 5 quenching efficiency. Studies with nonspecific DNA indicate that DNA hairpins immobilized on a gold surface retain

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_mhc_class_i_ben05">Membrane topology of receptors plays an important role in shaping transmembrane signalling of cells. Among the methods used
                  for characterizing receptor clusters, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a donor and acceptor fluorophore plays
                  a unique role based on its capability of detecting molecular level (2-10 nm) proximities of receptors in physiological conditions.
                  Recent development of biotechnology has made possible the usage of colloidal gold particles in a large size range for specific
                  labelling of cells for the purposes of electron microscopy. However, by combining metal and fluorophore labelling or cells,
                  the versatility of metal-fluorophore interactions opens the way for new applications by detecting the presence of the metal
                  particles by the methods of fluorescence spectroscopy. An outstanding feature of the metal nanoparticle-fluorophore interaction
                  is that the metal particle can enhance spontaneous emission of the fluorophore in a distance-dependent fashion, in an interaction
                  range esentially determined by the size of the nanoparticle. In our work enhanced fluorescence of rhodamine and cyanine dyes
                  was observed in the vicinity of immunogold nanoparticles on the surface of JY cells in a flow cytometer. The dyes and the
                  immunogold were targetted to the cell surface receptors MHCI, MHCII, transferrin receptor and CD45 by monoclonal antibodies.
                  The fluorescence enhancement was sensitive to the wavelength of the exciting light, the size and amount of surface bound gold
                  beads, as well as the fluorophore-nanoparticle distance. The intensity of 90&amp;DEG; scattering of the incident light beam was
                  enhanced by the immunogold in a concentration and size-dependent fashion. The 90&amp;DEG; light scattering varied with the wavelength
                  of the incident light in a manner characteristic to gold nanoparticles of the applied sizes. A reduction in photobleaching
                  time constant of the cyanine dye was observed in the vicinity of gold particles in a digital imaging microscope. Modulations
                  of 90&amp;DEG; light scattering intensity and photobleaching time constant indicate the role of the local field in the fluorescence
                  enhancement. A mathematical simulation based on the electrodynamic theory of fluorescence enhancement showed a consistency
                  between the measured enhancement values, the inter-epitope distances and the quantum yields. The feasibility of realizing
                  proximity sensors operating at distance ranges larger than that of the conventional Forster transfer is demonstrated on the
                  surface of living cells. Copyright &amp;COPY; 2004 John Wiley&amp; Sons, Ltd.

                  labeling and silver enhancement to generate opaque surface at area with target DNA hybridization. A photodiode fabricated
                  underneath the supporting surface can then be used to detect the light intensity changes, before and after the silver enhancement.
                  With this technique, we have successfully discriminated single base-mismatched DNA from matched DNA sequence, and the detection
                  limit could be as low as 10 pM. By exploiting the advanced modern IC manufacturing technology and the well-established electrochemical

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_microlenses_wie04a">A review of the subject of near-field optical imaging of metal nanoparticles is presented. The emphasis of the review is on
                  experimental achievements in optical imaging of single metal nanoparticles and nanostructured arrays with metal nanoparticle
                  building blocks. The importance of the measurements as they relate to nano-optical applications and scientific understanding
                  of optical near-fields is highlighted. Advancements in scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) that have enabled near-field
                  images of these structures are also featured, as are theoretical contributions for interpreting SNOM images.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_microscopy_bru05">Progress in near-field optical spectroscopy research on metal narroparticles demands a better understanding of the role of
                  particle-particle and tip-sample interactions. In this perspective, we investigate theoretically, at a very moderate level
                  of sophistication, the optical behavior of simple silver nanoparticle aggregates, in terms of a formalism involving a multipolar
                  expansion of the fields involved, along with a simplified model for the optical behavior of nanostructures previously developed.
                  In particular, the tip-sample interaction is taken into account roughly, treating the tip as an additional, single particle,
                  characterized by proper dielectric behavior.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_microscopy_hei05">We demonstrate that commercially available unmodified carbocyanine dyes such as Cy5 (usually excited at 633 nm) can be used
                  as efficient reversible single-molecule optical switch, whose fluorescent state after apparent photobleaching can be restored
                  at room temperature upon irradiation at shorter wavelengths. Ensemble photobleaching and recovery experiments of Cy5 in aqueous
                  solution irradiating first at 633 nm, then at 337, 488, or 532 nm, demonstrate that restoration of absorption and fluorescence
                  strongly depends on efficient oxygen removal and the addition of the triplet quencher -mercaptoethylamine. Single-molecule
                  fluorescence experiments show that individual immobilized Cy5 molecules can be switched optically in milliseconds by applying
                  alternating excitation at 633 and 488 nm between a fluorescent and nonfluorescent state up to 100 times with a reliability
                  of &gt;90% at room temperature. Because of their intriguing performance, carbocyanine dyes volunteer as a simple alternative
                  for ultrahigh-density optical data storage. Measurements on single donor/acceptor (tetramethylrhodamine/Cy5) labeled oligonucleotides
                  point out that the described light-driven switching behavior imposes fundamental limitations on the use of carbocyanine dyes
                  as energy transfer acceptors for the study of biological processes.

                  with emission/excitation spectra similar to those of AMCA, Lucifer Yellow, fluorescein, rhodamine 6G, tetramethylrhodamine
                  or Cy3, lissamine rhodamine B, and Texas Red, respectively (the numbers in the Alexa names indicate the approximate excitation
                  wavelength maximum in nm). All Alexa dyes and their conjugates are more fluorescent and more photostable than their commonly
                  used spectral analogues listed above. In addition, Alexa dyes are insensitive to pH in the 4-10 range. We evaluated Alexa
                  dyes compared with conventional dyes in applications using various conjugates, including those of goat anti-mouse IgG (GAM),
                  streptavidin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and concanavalin A (ConA). Conjugates of Alexa 546 are at least twofold more fluo-rescent
                  than Cy3 conjugates. Proteins labeled with the Alexa 568 or Alexa 594 dyes are several-fold brighter than the same proteins
                  labeled with lissamine rhodamine B or Texas Red dyes, respectively. Alexa dye derivatives of phalloidin stain F-actin with
                  high specificity. Hydrazide forms of the Alexa dyes are very bright, formaldehyde-fixable polar tracers. Conjugates of the
                  Alexa 430 (ex 430 nm/em 520 nm) and Alexa 532 (ex 530 nm/em 548 nm) fluorochromes are spectrally unique fluorescent probes,

                  Two DNA hairpins incorporating portions of the Staphlococcus aureus FemA and mecR methicillin-resistance genes were attached
                  to a gold substrate. Upon exposure to the complement, a Â 26-fold increase in fluorescence intensity was measured corresponding
                  to a 96 Â± 5 quenching efficiency. Studies with nonspecific DNA indicate that DNA hairpins immobilized on a gold surface retain

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_model_systems_bar05">Excited-state interactions between chlorophyll a (Chla) and gold nanoparticles have been studied. The emission intensity of
                  Chla is quenched by gold nanoparticles. The dominant process for this quenching has been attributed to the process of photoinduced
                  electron transfer from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, although because of a small overlap between fluorescence of Chla
                  and absorption of gold nanoparticles, the energy-transfer process cannot be ruled out. Photoinduced electron-transfer mechanism
                  is supported by the electrochemical modulation of fluorescence of Chla. In absence of an applied bias, Chla cast on gold film,
                  as a result of electron transfer, exhibits a very weak fluorescence. However, upon negatively charging the gold nanocore by
                  external bias, an increase in fluorescence intensity is observed. The negatively charged gold nanoparticles create a barrier
                  and suppress the electron-transfer process from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, resulting in an increase in radiative
                  process. Nanosecond laser flash experiments of Chla in the presence of gold nanoparticles and fullerene (C-60) have demonstrated
                  that Au nanoparticles, besides accepting electrons, can also mediate or shuttle electrons to another acceptor. Taking advantage
                  of these properties of gold nanoparticles, a photoelectrochemical cell based on Chla and gold nanoparticles is constructed.
                  A superior performance of this cell compared to that without the gold film is due to the beneficial role of gold nanoparticles
                  in accepting and shuttling the photogenerated electrons in Chla to the collecting electrode, leading to an enhancement in
                  charge separation efficiency.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_molecular_clusters_liv85">In this work we shall develop a formalism which extends previous calculations of lifetimes of excited molecular states near
                  planar dielectric surfaces and near single small dielectric particles to situations where the molecule is adsorbed on a cluster
                  made of several dielectric spherical grains. The nonradiative relaxation rate is seen to be relatively weakly dependent on
                  the cluster structure and, if the molecule is adsorbed on one of the grains, is well approximated by the single grain result.
                  The radiative decay rate and hence the quantum yield are much more sensitive to the geometry of the cluster which determines
                  the position (in frequency) of the dielectric resonances of the cluster. The formalism developed here may be used to evaluate
                  local field intensities at different positions within a cluster of dielectric grains under the influence of an external incident
                  field. The Journal of Chemical Physics is copyrighted by The American Institute of Physics.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_molecular_orientation_vie07">A phenomenological model is implemented to study the decay rates of fluorescing molecules in the vicinity of a metallic nanoparticle,
                  wherein the nonlocal optical response of the particle is accounted for via the hydrodynamic model for the description of the
                  free electrons in the metal. These nonlocal effects are examined for each of the radiative rate and the nonradiative rate
                  of the admolecule, respectively. In addition, the overall fluorescence rate which includes the enhancement ratio for the driving
                  field intensity is also studied. It is found that for particles of very small sizes (&lt;10 nm), the nonlocal effects, in general,
                  lead to significantly greater fluorescence rates and smaller nonradiative decay rates for the admolecules, with the effects
                  on radiative rates depending crucially on the orientation of the molecules. Furthermore, the effects are mostly noticeable
                  for molecules close to the metal particle and in processes where higher multipolar interactions are significant such as those
                  in nonradiative decay processes. Above all, these nonlocal effects can still be observable in the presence of large surface
                  damping imposed on the metallic electrons due to the ultrasmall sizes of these nanoparticles. The relevance of these effects
                  to some of the latest experiments is discussed.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_molecular_recognition_bon96">Molecular beacons are DNA probes that form a stem-and-loop structure and possess an internally quenched fluorophore. When
                  they bind to complementary nucleic acids, they undergo a conformational transition that switches on their fluorescence. These
                  probes recognize their targets with higher specificity than probes that cannot form a hairpin stem, and they easily discriminate
                  targets that differ from one another by only a single nucleotide. Our results show that molecular beacons can exist in three
                  different states: bound to a target, free in the form of a hairpin structure, and free in the form of a random coil. Thermodynamic
                  analysis of the transitions between these states reveals that enhanced specificity is a general feature of conformationally
                  constrained probes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_molecular_recognition_fre98">Previous thermodynamic and computational studies have pointed to the important energetic role of aromatic contacts in generating
                  the exceptional binding free energy of streptavidin-biotin association. We report here the crystallographic characterization
                  of single site tryptophan mutants in investigating structural consequences of alterations in these aromatic contacts. Four
                  tryptophan residues, Trp79, Trp92, Trp108 and Trp120, play an important role in the hydrophobic binding contributions, which
                  along with a hydrogen bonding network and a flexible binding loop give rise to tight ligand binding (KaÂ 1013M-1). The crystal
                  structures of ligand-free and biotin-bound mutants, W79F, W108F, W120F and W120A, in the resolution range from 1.9 to 2.3
                  A were determined. Nine data sets for these four different mutants were collected, and structural models were refined to R-values
                  ranging from 0.15 to 0.20. The major question addressed here is how these mutations influence the streptavidin binding site
                  and in particular how they affect the binding mode of biotin in the complex. The overall folding of streptavidin was not significantly
                  altered in any of the tryptophan mutants. With one exception, only minor deviations in the unbound structures were observed.
                  In one crystal form of unbound W79F, there is a coupled shift in the side-chains of Phe29 and Tyr43 toward the mutation site,
                  although in a different crystal form these shifts are not observed. In the bound structures, the orientation of biotin in
                  the binding pocket was not significantly altered in the mutant complex. Compared with the wild-type streptavidin-biotin complex,
                  there were no additional crystallographic water molecules observed for any of the mutants in the binding pocket. These structural
                  studies thus suggest that the thermodynamic alterations can be attributed to the local alterations in binding residue composition,
                  rather than a rearrangement of binding site architectures.

                  to first applications in materials science and life sciences. In this review some recent biological applications of colloidal
                  nanocrystals are discussed, without going into biological or chemical details. First, the properties of colloidal nanocrystals
                  and how they can be synthesized are described. Second, the conjugation of nanocrystals with biological molecules is discussed.
                  And third, three different biological applications are introduced: (i) the arrangement of nanocrystal-oligonucleotide conjugates
                  using molecular scaffolds such as single-stranded DNA, (ii) the use of nanocrystal-protein conjugates as fluorescent probes
                  for cellular imaging, and (iii) a motility assay based on the uptake of nanocrystals by living cells.

                  over large ranges. The results reveal at least three well-defined states of the TMRh-DNA molecules for the single-stranded
                  as well as for the double-stranded DNA molecules. Two states are fluorescent, with lifetimes in the range of 0.5-1 ns and

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_molecule_joh05">We present a general model study of surface-enhanced resonant Raman scattering and fluorescence, focusing on the interplay
                  between electromagnetic (EM) effects and the molecular dynamics as treated by a density matrix calculation. The model molecule
                  has two electronic levels, is affected by radiative and nonradiative damping mechanisms, and a Franck-Condon mechanism yields
                  electron-vibration coupling. The coupling between the molecule and the electromagnetic field is enhanced by placing it between
                  two Ag nanoparticles. The results show that the Raman scattering cross section can, for realistic parameter values, increase
                  by some 10 orders of magnitude (to similar to 10(-14) cm(2)) compared with the free-space case. Also the fluorescence cross
                  section grows with increasing EM enhancement, however, at a slower rate, and this increase eventually stalls when nonradiative
                  decay processes become important. Finally, we find that anti-Stokes Raman scattering is possible with strong incident laser
                  intensities similar to 1 mW/mu m(2).

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_molecules_alv05">In this work, the role of nanoparticle surface charge in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is examined for the common
                  case of measurements made in colloidal solutions of Ag and Au. Average SERS intensities obtained for several analytes (salicylic
                  acid, pyridine, and 2-naphthalenethiol) on Ag and An colloids are correlated with the pH and zeta potential (xi) values of
                  the nanoparticle solutions from which they were recorded. The consequence of the electrostatic interaction between the analyte
                  and the metallic nanoparticle is stressed. The xi potentials of three commonly used colloidal solutions are reported as a
                  function of pH, and a discussion is given on how these influence SERS intensity. Also examined is the importance of nanoparticle
                  aggregation (and colloidal solution collapse) in determining SERS intensities, and how this varies with the pH of the solution.
                  The results show that SERS enhancement is highest at xi potential values where the colloidal nanoparticle solutions are most
                  stable and where the electrostatic repulsion between the particles and the analyte molecules is minimized. These results suggest
                  some important criteria for consideration in all SERS measurements and also provide important insights into the problem of
                  predicting SERS activities for different molecular systems.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_molecules_fan03">Gold nanoparticles quench the fluorescence of cationic polyfluorene with Stern-Volmer constants (KSV) approaching 1011 M-1,
                  several orders of magnitude larger than any previously reported conjugated polymer-quencher pair and 9-10 orders of magnitude
                  larger than small molecule dye-quencher pairs. The dependence of KSV on ionic strength, charge and conjugation length of the
                  polymer, and the dimensions (and thus optical properties) of the nanoparticles suggests that three factors account for this
                  extraordinary efficiency: (i) amplification of the quenching via rapid internal energy or electron transfer, (ii) electrostatic
                  interactions between the cationic polymer and anionic nanoparticles, and (iii) the ability of gold nanoparticles to quench
                  via efficient energy transfer. As a result of this extraordinarily high KSV, quenching can be observed even at subpicomolar
                  concentrations of nanoparticles, suggesting that the combination of conjugated polymers with these nanomaterials can potentially
                  lead to improved sensitivity in optical biosensors.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_molecules_ler06">We address in this paper the long debated issue of the possibility of vibrational pumping under Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering
                  (SERS) conditions, both theoretically and experimentally. We revisit with simple theoretical models the mechanisms of vibrational
                  pumping and its relation to heating. This presentation provides a clear classification of the various regimes of heating/
                  pumping, from simple global laser heating to selective pumping of a single vibrational mode. We also propose the possibility
                  of extreme pumping driven by stimulated phonon emission, and we introduce and apply a new experimental technique to study
                  these effects in SERS. Our method relies on correlations between Raman peak parameters, and cross-correlation for two Raman
                  peaks. We find strong evidence for local and dynamical heating, but no convincing evidence for selective pumping under our
                  specific experimental SERS conditions.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_molecules_leu87">A dynamical approach to the classical decay rates for molecules near a dielectric sphere is presented through the application
                  of the diffraction theory for a dipole antenna established by Van del Pol and Bremmer. This theory is somewhat simpler than
                  but formally equivalent to that established by Ruppin and preserves a feature which is closer to the method of the theory
                  established by Chance, Prock, and Silbey for a flat surface. The results, when compared to those obtained from the static
                  image theory, show that this latter theory can be very inaccurate for large molecule-sphere distances or highly conducting
                  spheres, consistent with previous findings for surfaces with perfect flatness or small roughness. The Journal of Chemical

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_molecules_liv85">In this work we shall develop a formalism which extends previous calculations of lifetimes of excited molecular states near
                  planar dielectric surfaces and near single small dielectric particles to situations where the molecule is adsorbed on a cluster
                  made of several dielectric spherical grains. The nonradiative relaxation rate is seen to be relatively weakly dependent on
                  the cluster structure and, if the molecule is adsorbed on one of the grains, is well approximated by the single grain result.
                  The radiative decay rate and hence the quantum yield are much more sensitive to the geometry of the cluster which determines
                  the position (in frequency) of the dielectric resonances of the cluster. The formalism developed here may be used to evaluate
                  local field intensities at different positions within a cluster of dielectric grains under the influence of an external incident

                  field at the edge area. The formation of unconventional nanophotonic crescent moon structure is accomplished by using a sacrificial
                  nanosphere template and conventional thin film deposition method, which allows an effective batch nanofabrication and precise
                  controls of nanostructure shapes. Unique multiple scattering peaks are observed in a single gold nanocrescent moon with dark-field
                  white light illumination. A 785 nm near-infrared (NIR) diode laser was used as the excitation source to induce the amplified
                  scattering field on the sharp edge of the single gold nanocrescent moon. The Raman scattering spectrum of Rhodamine 6G molecules
                  adsorbed on the single gold nanocrescent moon are characterized, and the Raman enhancement factor of single gold nanocrescent
                  moon is estimated larger than 10(10), which suggests the potential applications of gold nanocrescent moons in ultrasensitive
                  biomolecular detection and cellular imaging using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy.

                  cross sections for different modes and also provides the determination of the asymmetry between the anti-Stokes and Stokes
                  SERS cross sections for each mode.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_molecules_nab03">Luminescent properties of the Eu(dinic) complex, where dinic is dinicotinic acid, were examined in the presence of silver
                  nanoparticles in N,N-dimethylformamide. The formation of particle aggregates was observed upon mixing the particle solution
                  with the complex solution, in which the complexes behaved like linker molecules. Luminescent intensity of the complexes was
                  enhanced in the presence of silver nanoparticles, but at only a limited particle concentration region. The observed particle
                  concentration dependences of the luminescent intensity were regarded as the result of a delicate balance between an enhancing
                  and a quenching effect of the silver nanoparticles. In addition to the change in intensity, silver nanoparticles also affected
                  the asymmetric ratio (or monochromaticity) of the europium luminescence. These changes in the luminescent properties of the
                  complex were discussed in terms of the effects of particle aggregates and consequent modifications of the local electromagnetic
                  field, refractive index, and the ligand field around europium ion.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_molecules_rup82">The decay of an excited molecule near a small metal sphere is considered from the viewpoint of electromagnetic theory. The
                  total decay rate of the emitting dipole is obtained by considering the two mechanisms through which energy is dissipated.
                  One is the radiative loss, which is calculated from the Poynting vector, and the other is the nonradiative decay which is
                  calculated from the Ohmic losses inside the sphere. Numerical computations are performed for the case of a molecule near a
                  small silver sphere, and the results are compared with those for a molecule near the planar boundary of a silver half-space.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_molecules_wei83">The enhancements of normal Raman scattering, resonance Raman scattering, and fluorescence from molecules adsorbed on identical,
                  well-characterized, silver-island films are reported. The enhancement arises from the electromagnetic interaction between
                  the molecules and the electronic plasma resonance of the silver islands. A hierarchy of enhancement ratios is found, with
                  typical values of 105 for RS, 103 for RRS and 10?1 to 10 for fluorescence, depending on the quantum yield of the molecular
                  fluorescence. A model, developed on heuristic grounds and substantiated using the density matrix formalism, describes the
                  light scattering processes and the effects of the plasma resonance. This model presents a unified picture of the surface-induced
                  enhancement effects and is consistent with the experimental values. The comparison of all the forms of optical scattering
                  leads to a complete determination of the role of the plasma resonances in the various portions of the scattering process.
                  The excitation of the electronic plasma resonance results in an increased local field at the molecules leading to an increased
                  excitation or absorption rate. Similarly, the excitation of the plasma resonance by the molecular emission dipole results
                  in an increase in the radiative decay rate. However, the electromagnetic coupling of the molecule to the plasma resonance
                  also adds an additional damping channel which can result in a reduction of the absorption or excitation rate as well as the
                  emission yield. The resultant balance of these processes leads to the hierarchy in the measured enhancements. The hierarchy
                  of enhancements is also shown to have important spectroscopic consequences.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_monolayers_gua05">Aqueous solutions of Au colloids (12 Â± 4 nm size) when treated with a blend of mono- and dithiols aggregate forming stable
                  clusters, as evidenced by the shift of their surface plasmon (SP) band from 512 to ca. 600 nm. The presence of carboxylate
                  ester functions on the dithiol allows its cleavage by addition of a cleaving agent, such as hydrazine. The cleavage process
                  results in the breaking down of the clusters of nanoparticles and the shift of the SP band back to lower wavelengths. Further
                  addition of dithiol causes the formation of the clusters again. The aggregation/deaggregation process may be monitored visually
                  by following the color change from pink-red to purple and vice versa in the forward and backward steps, respectively.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_monolayers_ohe05">An inhibition assay method was developed based on the modulation in the FRET efficiency between quantum dots (QDs) and gold
                  nanoparticles (AuNPs) in the presence of the molecules which inhibit the interactions between QD- and AuNP-conjugated biomolecules.
                  For the functionalization, AuNPs were first stabilized by chemisorption of n-alkanethiols and then capped with the first generation
                  polyamidoamine (G1 PAMAM) dendrimers. By employing a streptavidin-biotin couple as a model system, avidin was quantitatively
                  analyzed as an inhibitor by sensing the change in photoluminescence (PL) quenching of SA-QDs by biotin-AuNPs. The detection
                  limit for avidin was about 10 nM. It is anticipated that the PL quenching-based sensing system can be used for the quantitative
                  analysis and high throughput screening of molecules which inhibit the specific biomolecular interactions.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none"
                  id="abstract_mononucleotide_molecules_kne00">A method has been developed for highly sensitive detection of specific DNA sequences in a homogeneous assay using labeled
                  oligonucleotide molecules in combination with single-molecule photon burst counting and identification. The fluorescently
                  labeled oligonucleotides are called smart probes because they report the presence of complementary target sequences by a strong
                  increase in fluorescence intensity. The smart probes consist of a fluorescent dye attached at the terminus of a hairpin oligonucleotide.
                  The presented technique takes advantage of the fact that the used oxazine dye JA242 is efficiently quenched by complementary
                  guanosine residues. Upon specific hybridization to the target DNA, the smart probe undergoes a conformational change that
                  forces the fluorescent dye and the guanosine residues apart, thereby increasing the fluorescence intensity about six fold
                  in ensemble measurements. To increase the detection sensitivity below the nanomolar range, a confocal fluorescence microscope
                  was used to observe the fluorescence bursts from individual smart probes in the presence and absence of target DNA as they
                  passed through the focused laser beam. Smart probes were excited by a pulsed diode laser emitting at 635 nm with a repetition
                  rate of 64 MHz. Each fluorescence burst was identified by three independent parameters: (a) the burst size, (b) the burst
                  duration, and (c) the fluorescence lifetime. Through the use of this multiparameter analysis, higher discrimination accuracies
                  between smart probes and hybridized probe-target duplexes were achieved. The presented multiparameter detection technique
                  permits the identification of picomolar target DNA concentrations in a homogeneous assay, i.e., the detection of specific
                  DNA sequences in a 200-fold excess of labeled probe molecules.

                  By using quantum dots (QDs) emitting at different wavelengths, the measurement of the distance between these point light sources,
                  which are closer than the optical resolution of 200 nm, was achieved. The nanocrystals have major advantages over conventional
                  chromophores in higher quantum yield, more photostability, and the possibility of different emission wavelengths by an excitation
                  with a single wavelength. The colocalization of two single QDs at the least distance of 40 nm can be measured with a standard
                  deviation of 5 nm and a time resolution of 117 ms using one excitation wavelength.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_multilayered_sphere_mor05">Fast and numerically stable transfer-matrix solution is presented for the classical electromagnetics problem of a dipole radiating
                  inside and outside a stratified sphere consisting of concentric spherical shells. There is no limitation on the dipole position,
                  the number of the concentric shells, the shell medium, or on the sphere radius. Electromagnetic fields are determined anywhere
                  in the space, the time-averaged angular distribution of the radiated power, the total radiated power, Ohmic losses due to
                  an absorbing shell, and Green?s function are calculated. An absorbing, optically active, and ultrathin (less, approximate10
                  nm) metallic shell (core), characterized by a nonlocal dielectric function, are all allowed. The classical results are then
                  applied to inelastic light scattering (fluorescence and Raman), the radiative and nonradiative normalized decay rates, and
                  frequency shift. Using correspondence principle, the radiative decay rate is calculated from the Poynting vector, whereas
                  the nonradiative decay rate is calculated from the Ohmic losses inside a sphere absorptive shell. Numerical stability of our
                  method and limitations of classical description of decay rates are addressed. The importance of grouping various radiative
                  and nonradiative decay mechanisms into local and nonlocal decay rates is emphasized. Further possible extensions of the theory
                  presented here to the case of an arbitrary multilayered (axially symmetric) particle and to the classical problem of a radiating
                  quadrupole in the presence of a multilayered particle are briefly outlined. Various applications for chemical speciation,
                  LIDAR, fluorescent microscopy, engineering of decay rates, identification of biological particles, and monitoring specific
                  cell functions are envisaged. Computer program is freely available at http://www.wave-scattering.com.

                  with nearly identical absorption and emission characteristics but different fluorescent lifetimes and quantum yields, so called
                  multiplex dyes. Optical excitation of the rhodamine chromophor induces an intramolecular electron transfer between the rhodamine
                  subunit and the quenching molecule. As predicted by the classical theory of electron transfer we can control the rate of electron
                  transfer by the distance between the donor and the acceptor, e.g. different coupling positions and spacers, and the polarity
                  of the surrounding medium. We investigated the following quenchers: m-, o- and p-nitrobenzylamine, p-dimethylaminobenzylamine
                  and p-methoxybenzylamine.

                  (Os(bpy)(3)(2+)) as phosphorescent labels for the quantification of surface binding of molecules to gold and silver nanoparticles.
                  The fraction of Rtt(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) that is in solution can be distinguished from the surface-bound fraction
                  by the relative lifetimes and integrated emission yields as determined by time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) spectroscopy.
                  Complementary steady-state measurements were carried out to confirm surface attachment of the phosphorescent label molecules.
                  Although the emission of solutions of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) is quenched proportional to the concentration of 10
                  nm Au or 20 nm Ag nanoparticles, the quenching is static and not diffusional quenching observed in Stern-Volmer plots. The
                  results demonstrate that time-resolved spectroscopy provides a rapid method for the measurement of surface binding of labeled
                  molecules on metallic nanoparticles. While steady-state measurements require the preparation of a series of samples with varying
                  quencher concentrations and a reference, the method described herein requires a single sample plus reference. The mechanism
                  for phosphorescence quenching on Au and Ag nanoparticles is discussed in terms of energy and electron transfer theories.

                  nanoparticles (AuNPs) in the presence of the molecules which inhibit the interactions between QD- and AuNP-conjugated biomolecules.
                  For the functionalization, AuNPs were first stabilized by chemisorption of n-alkanethiols and then capped with the first generation
                  polyamidoamine (G1 PAMAM) dendrimers. By employing a streptavidin-biotin couple as a model system, avidin was quantitatively
                  analyzed as an inhibitor by sensing the change in photoluminescence (PL) quenching of SA-QDs by biotin-AuNPs. The detection
                  limit for avidin was about 10 nM. It is anticipated that the PL quenching-based sensing system can be used for the quantitative
                  analysis and high throughput screening of molecules which inhibit the specific biomolecular interactions.

                  investigated. The electronic transitions of both dyes showed solvatochromic shifts due to specific interactions of the ligands
                  with the solvent molecules. The surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectra of the dyes dissolved in water, ethanol, and acetonitrile
                  were measured in silver and gold colloidal solutions. The results demonstrate that the dyes were adsorbed on the metallic
                  nanoparticles in different ways for different solvents. It was also found that in the gold colloid, the aqueous solutions
                  of both dyes did not produce any SERS signal, whereas in ethanolic solution the SERS effect was very weak. Deprotonation,
                  H-bonding, and donor-acceptor interactions seem to determine these different behaviors. Our results indicate the important
                  role of the charge-transfer mechanism in SERS.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_nanocrystals_asl04a">Biotinylated gold nanoparticles were prepared by using a two-step surface modification procedure. First, a carboxyl-terminated
                  alkanethiol was chemisorbed onto the surface of gold nanoparticles in the presence of a stabilizing agent. Subsequently, the
                  carboxyl groups were reacted with (+)-biotinyl-3,6,9,-trioxaundecanediamine and 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol. This procedure resulted
                  in stable, ligand-modified gold nanoparticles. Upon interaction with streptavidin, the biotinylated gold nanoparticles aggregated
                  by means of specific biomolecular recognition. Their aggregation was studied by optical absorption spectroscopy. Controlled
                  aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles resulted in a shift in the surface plasmon resonance peak and broadening of
                  the absorption spectrum of the nanoparticles. The spectral changes were used to assess the extent of aggregation. Aggregation
                  was found to be dependent on the concentrations of streptavidin, biotinylated gold nanoparticles, and the surface mole fraction
                  of biotin groups on the nanoparticles. Maximum aggregation was observed when 24 nM streptavidin and 0.80 nM biotinylated gold
                  nanoparticles were used. Reversal of nanoparticle aggregation was accomplished by the addition of soluble biotin to the streptavidin-nanoparticle
                  aggregates. Kinetic analysis of the absorbance data showed that streptavidin-induced aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles
                  could be interpreted in terms of a Reaction-Limited Colloidal Aggregation (RLCA) model. This indicates that optical absorption
                  spectroscopy can provide a quantitative measurement of the aggregation process.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_nanocrystals_che04">For the first time, an aqueous solution of 32-nm gold nanoparticles (GNPs), to which Nile red (NR) has been noncovalently
                  adsorbed, has been used for sensing thiols. The as-prepared NRGNPs fluoresce weakly as a result of fluorescence resonance
                  energy transfer between NR and the GNPs. The fluorescence of a solution containing NRGNPs at pH 4.0 increases upon the addition
                  of thiols, but not when amines, acids, alcohols, bovine serum albumin, or hemoglobin are added. This phenomenon allows for
                  the selective determination of thiols such as cysteamine and homocysteine, which have limits of detection of 10.2 and 10.9
                  nM, respectively, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. Interestingly, we have found that the excitation (ex = 480 nm), emission
                  (em = 610 nm), and mass spectra (m/z 282) of the substance that desorbs from the GNPs in the presence of thiols are different
                  from those of NR (ex = 580 nm; em = 652 nm; m/z 318), which indicates that a new product forms. When simultaneously conducting
                  fluorescence and colorimetric assays, the selectivity of this approach further improves because at pH 4.0, the color of the
                  NRGNPs does not change in the presence of negatively charged thiols, (e.g., N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine), but changes from
                  maroon to purple and lavender in the presence of neutral thiols (e.g., 3-mercapto-1,2-propanediol) and positively charged
                  thiols (e.g., cysteamine), respectively, as a result of aggregation. This feature allows the types of thiols to be determined
                  at concentrations &gt;1.0 and 0.1 ÂµM by the naked eye and by UV-vis absorption, respectively. Depending on the rate at which
                  the NRGNP color changes, reduced glutathione (slow) is readily distinguishable from oxidized glutathione (no aggregation and
                  no displacement) and from cysteine and homocysteine (fast).

                  polyamidoamine (G1 PAMAM) dendrimers. By employing a streptavidin-biotin couple as a model system, avidin was quantitatively
                  analyzed as an inhibitor by sensing the change in photoluminescence (PL) quenching of SA-QDs by biotin-AuNPs. The detection
                  limit for avidin was about 10 nM. It is anticipated that the PL quenching-based sensing system can be used for the quantitative

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_nanogram_levels_asl05">Gold colloids are well known to display strong plasmon absorption bands due to electron oscillations induced by the incident
                  light. When the colloids are in proximity, the plasmon absorption bands are often perturbed. This has enabled us recently
                  to successfully develop a glucose sensing platform based on the disassociation of dextrancoated gold colloids, cross-linked
                  with Con A, by glucose. However, a much more useful and simpler property of gold colloids, which has been ill explored with
                  regard to sensing, is their ability to efficiently scatter excitation fight. We have found that our nanogold sensing aggregates
                  are indeed efficient light scatters around the nanogold plasmon absorption band. By measuring the ratio of scattered fight
                  intensities at two different arbitrary wavelengths, 560 and 680 nm, glucose concentrations can be readily determined from
                  a few millimolar up to similar to 60 mM, using a simple white light LED and detection system. Further, by measuring the ratio
                  of the scattered intensities, this sensing approach is independent of the total sensing aggregate concentration and the excitation
                  and detection instrumentation fluctuations or drifts. This simplistic and low-cost approach to glucose sensing, coupled with
                  the sensing aggreagates' ability to scatter red light, suggests the potential use of these aggregates for use in physiological
                  transdermal glucose monitoring, either for implantable skin sensors or glucose sensing tattoos (discussed later).

                  field at the edge area. The formation of unconventional nanophotonic crescent moon structure is accomplished by using a sacrificial
                  nanosphere template and conventional thin film deposition method, which allows an effective batch nanofabrication and precise
                  controls of nanostructure shapes. Unique multiple scattering peaks are observed in a single gold nanocrescent moon with dark-field
                  white light illumination. A 785 nm near-infrared (NIR) diode laser was used as the excitation source to induce the amplified
                  scattering field on the sharp edge of the single gold nanocrescent moon. The Raman scattering spectrum of Rhodamine 6G molecules
                  adsorbed on the single gold nanocrescent moon are characterized, and the Raman enhancement factor of single gold nanocrescent
                  moon is estimated larger than 10(10), which suggests the potential applications of gold nanocrescent moons in ultrasensitive
                  biomolecular detection and cellular imaging using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy.

                  labeling and silver enhancement to generate opaque surface at area with target DNA hybridization. A photodiode fabricated
                  underneath the supporting surface can then be used to detect the light intensity changes, before and after the silver enhancement.
                  With this technique, we have successfully discriminated single base-mismatched DNA from matched DNA sequence, and the detection
                  limit could be as low as 10 pM. By exploiting the advanced modern IC manufacturing technology and the well-established electrochemical
                  immobilization of DNA, this approach has the potential to be used to construct a portable high-density DNA nanoarray system
                  with fully electronic readout. &amp;COPY; 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_nanoparticles_and04">We present a model to evaluate the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of electronic excited states of a molecule close to
                  a metal particle of complex shape and, possibly, in the presence of a solvent. The molecule is treated quantum mechanically
                  at Hartree?Fock (HF) or density-functional theory (DFT) level. The metal/solvent is considered as a continuous body, characterized
                  by its frequency dependent local dielectric constant. For simple metal shapes (planar infinite surface and spherical particle)
                  a version of the polarizable continuum model based on the integral equation formalism has been used, while an alternative
                  methodology has been implemented to treat metal particles of arbitrary shape. In both cases, equations have been numerically
                  solved using a boundary element method. Excitation energies and nonradiative decay rates due to the energy transfer from the
                  molecule to the metal are evaluated exploiting the linear response theory (TDHF or TDDFT where TD?time dependent). The radiative
                  decay rate of the whole system (molecule+metal/solvent) is calculated, still using a continuum model, in terms of the response
                  of the surrounding to the molecular transition. The model presented has been applied to the study of the radiative and nonradiative
                  lifetimes of a lissamine molecule in solution (water) and close to gold spherical nanoparticles of different radius. In addition,
                  the influence of the metal shape has been analyzed by performing calculations on a system composed by a coumarin-type molecule
                  close to silver aggregates of complex shape.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_nanoparticles_ang06">We present an experimental and theoretical study of the fluorescence rate of a single molecule as a function of its distance
                  to a laser-irradiated gold nanoparticle. The local field enhancement leads to an increased excitation rate whereas nonradiative
                  energy transfer to the particle leads to a decrease of the quantum yield (quenching). Because of these competing effects,
                  previous experiments showed either fluorescence enhancement or fluorescence quenching. By varying the distance between molecule
                  and particle we show the first experimental measurement demonstrating the continuous transition from fluorescence enhancement
                  to fluorescence quenching. This transition cannot be explained by treating the particle as a polarizable sphere in the dipole
                  approximation.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_nanoparticles_bra05">We extend the plasmon hybridization method to investigate the plasmon modes of metallic nanoshell dimers. The formalism is
                  also generalized to include the effects of dielectric backgrounds. It is shown that the presence of dielectrics shifts the
                  plasmon resonances of the individual nanoparticles to lower energies and screens their interaction in the dimer configuration.
                  The net result is a redshift of dimer energies compared to the system without dielectrics and a weaker dependence of the dimer
                  plasmon energies on dimer separation. We calculate the plasmon energies and optical absorption of nanoshell dimers as a function
                  of dimer separation. The results are in excellent agreement with the results of finite difference time domain simulations.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_nanoparticles_duh03">There is a keen interest in developing techniques for rapid genetic analysis that do not require labeling of an analyte. Here
                  we demonstrate that fluorophore-tagged DNA hairpins attached to gold films can function as immobilized "molecular beacons".
                  Two DNA hairpins incorporating portions of the Staphlococcus aureus FemA and mecR methicillin-resistance genes were attached
                  to a gold substrate. Upon exposure to the complement, a Â 26-fold increase in fluorescence intensity was measured corresponding
                  to a 96 Â± 5 quenching efficiency. Studies with nonspecific DNA indicate that DNA hairpins immobilized on a gold surface retain
                  their ability to bind complementary DNA sequences selectively.

                  than the efficiencies determined from metal films. Our experimental findings are explained with a process in which excited
                  d-band holes recombine nonradiatively with sp electrons, emitting particle plasmons. These plasmons subsequently radiate,
                  giving rise to the photoluminescence observed in the experiment. We determine the quantum efficiencies involved in this process.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_nanoparticles_pus06">We present a microscopic model for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) from molecules adsorbed on small noble-metal nanoparticles.
                  In the absence of direct overlap of molecular orbitals and electronic states in the metal, the main enhancement source is
                  the strong electric field of the surface plasmon resonance in a nanoparticle acting on a molecule near the surface. In small
                  particles, the electromagnetic enhancement is strongly modified by quantum-size effects. We show that, in nanometer-sized
                  particles, SERS magnitude is determined by a competition between several quantum-size effects such as the Landau damping of
                  surface plasmon resonance and reduced screening near the nanoparticle surface. Using time-dependent local density approximation,
                  we calculate spatial distribution of local fields near the surface and enhancement factor for different nanoparticles sizes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_nanoparticles_vie07">A phenomenological model is implemented to study the decay rates of fluorescing molecules in the vicinity of a metallic nanoparticle,
                  wherein the nonlocal optical response of the particle is accounted for via the hydrodynamic model for the description of the
                  free electrons in the metal. These nonlocal effects are examined for each of the radiative rate and the nonradiative rate
                  of the admolecule, respectively. In addition, the overall fluorescence rate which includes the enhancement ratio for the driving
                  field intensity is also studied. It is found that for particles of very small sizes (&lt;10 nm), the nonlocal effects, in general,
                  lead to significantly greater fluorescence rates and smaller nonradiative decay rates for the admolecules, with the effects
                  on radiative rates depending crucially on the orientation of the molecules. Furthermore, the effects are mostly noticeable
                  for molecules close to the metal particle and in processes where higher multipolar interactions are significant such as those
                  in nonradiative decay processes. Above all, these nonlocal effects can still be observable in the presence of large surface
                  damping imposed on the metallic electrons due to the ultrasmall sizes of these nanoparticles. The relevance of these effects
                  to some of the latest experiments is discussed.

                  biology. {T}raditional {F}Ã¶rster resonance energy transfer ({FRET}) is efficient for separation distances up to 100 {\AA}.
                  {W}e report the first successful application of a dipole-surface type energy transfer from a molecular dipole to a nanometal
                  surface that more than doubles the traditional {F}Ã¶rster range (220 {\AA}) and follows a 1/{R}4 distance dependence. {W}e
                  appended a 1.4 nm {A}u cluster to the 5' end of one {DNA} strand as the energy acceptor and a fluorescein ({FAM}) to the 5'
                  end of the complementary strand as the energy donor. {A}nalysis of the energy transfer on {DNA} lengths (15, 20, 30, 60bp),
                  complemented by protein-induced {DNA} bending, provides the basis for fully mapping the extent of this dipole surface type
                  mechanism over its entire usable range (50-250 {\AA}). {F}urther, protein function is fully compatible with these nanometal-{DNA}

                  particle-particle and tip-sample interactions. In this perspective, we investigate theoretically, at a very moderate level
                  of sophistication, the optical behavior of simple silver nanoparticle aggregates, in terms of a formalism involving a multipolar
                  expansion of the fields involved, along with a simplified model for the optical behavior of nanostructures previously developed.
                  In particular, the tip-sample interaction is taken into account roughly, treating the tip as an additional, single particle,
                  characterized by proper dielectric behavior.

                  and a quenching effect of the silver nanoparticles. In addition to the change in intensity, silver nanoparticles also affected
                  the asymmetric ratio (or monochromaticity) of the europium luminescence. These changes in the luminescent properties of the
                  complex were discussed in terms of the effects of particle aggregates and consequent modifications of the local electromagnetic
                  field, refractive index, and the ligand field around europium ion.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_nanoshells_luy05">We present novel gold nanophotonic crescent moon structures with a sub-10 nm sharp edge, which can enhance local electromagnetic
                  field at the edge area. The formation of unconventional nanophotonic crescent moon structure is accomplished by using a sacrificial
                  nanosphere template and conventional thin film deposition method, which allows an effective batch nanofabrication and precise
                  controls of nanostructure shapes. Unique multiple scattering peaks are observed in a single gold nanocrescent moon with dark-field
                  white light illumination. A 785 nm near-infrared (NIR) diode laser was used as the excitation source to induce the amplified
                  scattering field on the sharp edge of the single gold nanocrescent moon. The Raman scattering spectrum of Rhodamine 6G molecules
                  adsorbed on the single gold nanocrescent moon are characterized, and the Raman enhancement factor of single gold nanocrescent
                  moon is estimated larger than 10(10), which suggests the potential applications of gold nanocrescent moons in ultrasensitive
                  biomolecular detection and cellular imaging using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy.

                  of colloidal gold in the middle 1800s. More recently, new lithographic techniques as well as improvements to classical wet
                  chemistry methods have made it possible to synthesize noble metal nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes, shapes, and dielectric
                  environments. In this feature article, we describe recent progress in the theory of nanoparticle optical properties, particularly
                  methods for solving Maxwell's equations for light scattering from particles of arbitrary shape in a complex environment. Included
                  is a description of the qualitative features of dipole and quadrupole plasmon resonances for spherical particles; a discussion
                  of analytical and numerical methods for calculating extinction and scattering cross-sections, local fields, and other optical
                  properties for nonspherical particles; and a survey of applications to problems of recent interest involving triangular silver

                  media, metallic nanorings, spheres, gratings, and other complex geometries is investigated. Strong emission enhancement effects
                  are obtained in some of these geometries associated to the excitation of plasmons (e.g., in nanorings or spheres). Furthermore,
                  the emission is shown to take place only along narrow angular distributions when the atom is located inside a low-index dielectric
                  and near its planar surface, or when metallic nanogratings are employed at certain resonant wave lengths. In particular, axially
                  symmetric gratings made of real silver metal are considered, and both emission rate enhancement and focused far-field emission
                  are achieved simultaneously when the grating is decorated with further nanostructures.

                  are investigated by means of time-resolved fluorescence experiments. A pronounced fluorescence quenching is observed already
                  for the smallest nanoparticles of 1 nm radius. The quenching is caused not only by an increased nonradiative rate but, equally
                  important, by a drastic decrease in the dye's radiative rate. Assuming resonant energy transfer to be responsible for the
                  nonradiative decay channel, we compare our experimental findings with theoretical results derived from the Gersten-Nitzan

                  can be resonant or phonon-assisted. In both cases, the transfer rates strongly depend on the resonance conditions. The spin
                  selection rules in the transfer process come from the exchange and spin-orbit interactions. The character of energy dissipation
                  in spin transfer is different than that in the traditional spin currents. The spin-dependent photon cross-correlation functions
                  reflect the exciton transfer process. In addition, a mathematical method to calculate FÃ¶rster transfer in crystalline nanostructures
                  beyond the dipole-dipole approximation is described.

                  id="abstract_nanostructured_materials_lar04">We consider a nanoscale dipolar emitter (quantum dot, atom, fluorescent molecule, or rare-earth ion) in a nanometer proximity
                  to a flat metal surface. There is strong interaction of this emitter with unscreened metal electrons in the surface nanolayer
                  that causes enhanced relaxation due to surface plasmon excitation and Landau damping. To describe these phenomena, we developed
                  analytical theory based on local random-phase approximation. For the system considered, conventional theory based on metal
                  as continuous dielectric fails both qualitatively and quantitatively. Applications of the present theory and related phenomena

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none"
                  id="abstract_nanostructured_materials_mer07">We present a theoretical study of the modifications of the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of an optical emitter in
                  close proximity to a noble-metal nanosphere, based on exact electrodynamical theory. We show that the optimal nanosphere diameter
                  for luminescence quantum efficiency enhancement associated with resonant coupling to plasmon modes is in the range of 30-110
                  nm, depending on the material properties. The optimal diameter is found to be a trade-off between (1) emitter-plasmon coupling,
                  which is most effective for small spheres, and (2) the outcoupling of plasmons into radiation, which is most efficient for
                  large spheres. In addition, we show that the well-known Gersten and Nitzan model does not describe the existence of a finite
                  optimal diameter unless the model is extended with the correction factor for radiation damping. With this correction and a
                  correction for dynamic depolarization, the mathematically simpler Gersten and Nitzan model provides a reasonably accurate
                  approximation of the decay rate modifications associated with coupling to the dipole plasmon mode. We anticipate that the
                  Gersten and Nitzan model in the form that we validate in this paper for spheres will allow the analytical investigation of
                  the influence of shape anisotropy on plasmon-enhanced luminescence.

                  An experimental method has been developed that begins with the detection and characterization of isolated nanoparticles in
                  the optical far field. The plasmon resonance optical spectrum of many individual nanoparticles are then correlated to their
                  size and shape using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We find that specific geometrical shapes give distinct
                  spectral responses. In addition, inducing subtle changes in the particles' morphology by heating causes a shift in the individual
                  particle spectrum and provides a simple means of tuning the spectral response to a desired optical wavelength. Improved colloidal
                  preparation methods could potentially lead to homogeneous populations of identical particle shapes and colors. These multicolor
                  colloids could be used as biological labels, surface enhanced Raman scattering substrates, or near field optical microscopy
                  sources covering the full range of wavelengths in the visible spectrum.

                  by applying an electric field. Light scattering experiments on single gold nanoparticles show that spherically shaped nanoparticles
                  become optically spheroidal when covered by an anisotropic liquid crystal. The two particle plasmon resonances of the optically

                  The particles are placed in an evanescent field produced by total internal reflection of light from a halogen lamp in a glass
                  prism. The light scattered by individual particles is collected using a conventional microscope and is spectrally analyzed
                  by a nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled-device array coupled to a spectrometer. This technique is employed to measure the effect
                  of particle diameter on the dephasing time of the particle plasmon resonance in gold nanoparticles. We also demonstrate the

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_nanostructured_metal_mos05">The electromagnetic theory of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), despite its simplicity, can account for all major
                  SERS observations, including: the need for a nanostructured material as the SERS-active system; the observation that some
                  metals form good SERS-active systems while others do not; the observation that strongly interacting metal nanoparticles result
                  in very much more effective SERS-active systems; the observed polarization sensitivity shown by nanoparticle aggregates; and
                  the optical behavior of nanostructured metals in the absence of a molecular adsorbate. By extending the ideas inherent in
                  the electromagnetic model one can also understand the seminal features reported for single-molecule SERS, including the puzzling
                  observation that only a few silver particles in an ensemble are hot (they are appropriately structured nanoparticle clusters)
                  and that for a hot particle, once one is able to observe SERS, adding more adsorbate does not significantly alter the intensity
                  (once the electromagnetic hot spot is occupied, adding adsorbate to other sites on the nanoparticle cluster will not add greatly
                  to the observed intensity). However, the electromagnetic model does not account for all that is learned through SERS. Molecular
                  resonances, charge-transfer transitions and other processes such as ballistic electrons transiently probing the region where
                  the molecule resides and then modulating electronic processes of the metal as a result certainly contribute to the rich information
                  SERS reports; and by virtue of the fact that these contributions will vary from molecule to molecule, they will constitute
                  the most interesting aspects reported by SERS. But, the overall reason why SERS produces such inordinate enhancements is largely
                  an electromagnetic property of nanostructures.

                  enhancement near metalized surfaces to bioassays. We discuss a number of methods for various shaped silver particle deposition

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_near_field_optical_mor05">Fast and numerically stable transfer-matrix solution is presented for the classical electromagnetics problem of a dipole radiating
                  inside and outside a stratified sphere consisting of concentric spherical shells. There is no limitation on the dipole position,
                  the number of the concentric shells, the shell medium, or on the sphere radius. Electromagnetic fields are determined anywhere
                  in the space, the time-averaged angular distribution of the radiated power, the total radiated power, Ohmic losses due to
                  an absorbing shell, and Green?s function are calculated. An absorbing, optically active, and ultrathin (less, approximate10
                  nm) metallic shell (core), characterized by a nonlocal dielectric function, are all allowed. The classical results are then
                  applied to inelastic light scattering (fluorescence and Raman), the radiative and nonradiative normalized decay rates, and
                  frequency shift. Using correspondence principle, the radiative decay rate is calculated from the Poynting vector, whereas
                  the nonradiative decay rate is calculated from the Ohmic losses inside a sphere absorptive shell. Numerical stability of our
                  method and limitations of classical description of decay rates are addressed. The importance of grouping various radiative
                  and nonradiative decay mechanisms into local and nonlocal decay rates is emphasized. Further possible extensions of the theory
                  presented here to the case of an arbitrary multilayered (axially symmetric) particle and to the classical problem of a radiating
                  quadrupole in the presence of a multilayered particle are briefly outlined. Various applications for chemical speciation,
                  LIDAR, fluorescent microscopy, engineering of decay rates, identification of biological particles, and monitoring specific
                  cell functions are envisaged. Computer program is freely available at http://www.wave-scattering.com.

                  of sophistication, the optical behavior of simple silver nanoparticle aggregates, in terms of a formalism involving a multipolar
                  expansion of the fields involved, along with a simplified model for the optical behavior of nanostructures previously developed.
                  In particular, the tip-sample interaction is taken into account roughly, treating the tip as an additional, single particle,
                  characterized by proper dielectric behavior.

                  id="abstract_near_field_scanning_optical_microscopy_hud03">A near-field optical imaging approach is demonstrated for simultaneous topographic and spectroscopic imaging with spatial
                  resolution beyond the optical diffraction limit. The method combines metallic-tip-based tapping-mode atomic force microscopy
                  (AFM) with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The AFM metallic tip was formed by sputter coating a Si tapping
                  mode tip with Au, in a way that forms a globular tip apex. Such tip apex generates high local electric field enhancement under
                  laser illumination, which provides a strong electric-field interaction between the AFM tip and the fluorescent molecules under
                  the tip. The tip perturbation of fluorescence gives the fluorescence lifetime changes that provide the AFM-FLIM imaging contrast.
                  A finite element method simulation was used to further evaluate the electric near-field enhancement and electric field distribution
                  originating from the metallic Au-coated AFM tapping-mode tip. We have demonstrated that spatially mapping the change in fluorescence
                  lifetime and intensity is a promising approach to spectroscopic imaging at an AFM spatial resolution typically defined by
                  the apex diameter of the AFM tips. The globular Au-coated AFM tip not only gives adequate spatial AFM tapping-mode imaging
                  spatial resolution but also is "environmentally friendly" to soft samples, such as polymeric dye-labeled nanospheres and even
                  biological specimens such as POPO-3 labeled DNA.

                  lifetime and the fluorescence rate of single molecules are recorded simultaneously as a function of the tip position relative

                  id="abstract_noble_metal_nanoparticles_gou05">In this paper, the fabrication, characterization, and application of unique layer-by-layer (LBL) films of dendrimers and metallic
                  nanoparticles is reported. Silver nanoparticles (d = Â 20 nm) are produced in solution by sodium citrate reduction and incorporated
                  into thin films with generation 1 and 5 DAB-Am dendrimers (polypropylenimine dendrimers with amino surface groups) by the
                  LBL technique. The resulting nanocomposite films are characterized by UV-visible surface plasmon absorption and atomic force
                  microscopy (AFM) measurements, and employed as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of 2-naphthalenethiol.
                  Through variation of the molecular size (dendrimer generation) and concentration of the cross-linker used, as well as the
                  number of layers produced, the optical properties of several different possible architectures are studied. In the films, Ag
                  nanoparticles are shown to be effectively immobilized and stabilized with increased control over their spacing and aggregation.
                  Moreover, the films are shown to be excellent substrates for SERS measurements, demonstrating significant enhancement capability.
                  As expected, large electromagnetic enhancement of Raman scattering signals is found to be strongly dependent on interparticle
                  coupling between neighboring metallic nanoparticles. Finally, the possibility of detecting SERS signals from architectures
                  with intervening layers between the metal nanoparticles and analyte molecules is explored. It is shown that although there
                  are decreases in intensity with increasing number of intervening layers (as is expected from the distance dependence of SERS),
                  electromagnetic enhancement is still able to function at these distances, thus offering the possibility of developing sensors
                  with external layers that are chemically selective for specific analytes.

                  and engineers who wish to use them for the development of new generation nanodevices. Metal nanoparticles such as gold and
                  silver show noticeable photoactivity under UV-visible irradiation as is evident from the photoinduced fusion and fragmentation
                  processes. Binding a photoactive molecule (e.g., pyrene) to metal nanoparticle enhances the photochemical activity and renders
                  the organic-inorganic hybrid nanoassemblies suitable for light-harvesting and optoelectronic applications. The nature of charge-transfer
                  interaction of fluorophore with gold surface dictates the pathways with which the excited-state deactivates. Obtaining insight
                  into energy and electron-transfer processes is important to improve the charge separation efficiencies in metal-fluorophore
                  nanoassemblies and photocatalytic activity of metal-semiconductor composites.

                  properties of individual metallic particles. {W}e start by giving a historical overview and a conceptual discussion on the
                  subject of small particles, underlining their potential applications. {S}implified optical response functions for a metallic
                  sphere are introduced and duly illustrated to bring out the physical content. {P}articular emphasis is given to optical absorption,
                  resonance effects and far-infrared properties exhibited by simple and noble metal particles having less than 100 {\AA} radii.
                  {A} comparison between the traditional ({M}ie) approach and the proposed non-local scheme is made and it leads to an increased
                  understanding of the various mechanisms a small particle exhibits when screening an external electromagnetic field.

                  id="abstract_nonradiative_decay_rate_mor05">Fast and numerically stable transfer-matrix solution is presented for the classical electromagnetics problem of a dipole radiating
                  inside and outside a stratified sphere consisting of concentric spherical shells. There is no limitation on the dipole position,
                  the number of the concentric shells, the shell medium, or on the sphere radius. Electromagnetic fields are determined anywhere
                  in the space, the time-averaged angular distribution of the radiated power, the total radiated power, Ohmic losses due to
                  an absorbing shell, and Green?s function are calculated. An absorbing, optically active, and ultrathin (less, approximate10
                  nm) metallic shell (core), characterized by a nonlocal dielectric function, are all allowed. The classical results are then
                  applied to inelastic light scattering (fluorescence and Raman), the radiative and nonradiative normalized decay rates, and
                  frequency shift. Using correspondence principle, the radiative decay rate is calculated from the Poynting vector, whereas
                  the nonradiative decay rate is calculated from the Ohmic losses inside a sphere absorptive shell. Numerical stability of our
                  method and limitations of classical description of decay rates are addressed. The importance of grouping various radiative
                  and nonradiative decay mechanisms into local and nonlocal decay rates is emphasized. Further possible extensions of the theory
                  presented here to the case of an arbitrary multilayered (axially symmetric) particle and to the classical problem of a radiating
                  quadrupole in the presence of a multilayered particle are briefly outlined. Various applications for chemical speciation,
                  LIDAR, fluorescent microscopy, engineering of decay rates, identification of biological particles, and monitoring specific
                  cell functions are envisaged. Computer program is freely available at http://www.wave-scattering.com.

                  id="abstract_nonradiative_transitions_and04">We present a model to evaluate the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of electronic excited states of a molecule close to
                  a metal particle of complex shape and, possibly, in the presence of a solvent. The molecule is treated quantum mechanically
                  at Hartree?Fock (HF) or density-functional theory (DFT) level. The metal/solvent is considered as a continuous body, characterized
                  by its frequency dependent local dielectric constant. For simple metal shapes (planar infinite surface and spherical particle)
                  a version of the polarizable continuum model based on the integral equation formalism has been used, while an alternative
                  methodology has been implemented to treat metal particles of arbitrary shape. In both cases, equations have been numerically
                  solved using a boundary element method. Excitation energies and nonradiative decay rates due to the energy transfer from the
                  molecule to the metal are evaluated exploiting the linear response theory (TDHF or TDDFT where TD?time dependent). The radiative
                  decay rate of the whole system (molecule+metal/solvent) is calculated, still using a continuum model, in terms of the response
                  of the surrounding to the molecular transition. The model presented has been applied to the study of the radiative and nonradiative
                  lifetimes of a lissamine molecule in solution (water) and close to gold spherical nanoparticles of different radius. In addition,
                  the influence of the metal shape has been analyzed by performing calculations on a system composed by a coumarin-type molecule
                  close to silver aggregates of complex shape.

                  to a laser-irradiated gold nanoparticle. The local field enhancement leads to an increased excitation rate whereas nonradiative
                  energy transfer to the particle leads to a decrease of the quantum yield (quenching). Because of these competing effects,
                  previous experiments showed either fluorescence enhancement or fluorescence quenching. By varying the distance between molecule
                  and particle we show the first experimental measurement demonstrating the continuous transition from fluorescence enhancement
                  to fluorescence quenching. This transition cannot be explained by treating the particle as a polarizable sphere in the dipole
                  approximation.

                  investigated. The electronic transitions of both dyes showed solvatochromic shifts due to specific interactions of the ligands
                  with the solvent molecules. The surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectra of the dyes dissolved in water, ethanol, and acetonitrile
                  were measured in silver and gold colloidal solutions. The results demonstrate that the dyes were adsorbed on the metallic
                  nanoparticles in different ways for different solvents. It was also found that in the gold colloid, the aqueous solutions
                  of both dyes did not produce any SERS signal, whereas in ethanolic solution the SERS effect was very weak. Deprotonation,
                  H-bonding, and donor-acceptor interactions seem to determine these different behaviors. Our results indicate the important
                  role of the charge-transfer mechanism in SERS.

                  and rate equation formalisms, we show that, for surface coverages at which the surface immobilized molecules interact, barriers
                  to penetration create a distribution of target molecule concentrations within the adsorbed layer. By approximately enumerating
                  probe and target conformations, we estimate the probability of overlap between complementary probe and target regions as a
                  function of probe density and chain length. In agreement with experiments, we find that as probe molecules interact more strongly,
                  fewer nucleation sites become accessible and binding rates are diminished relative to those in solution. Nucleation sites
                  near the grafted end of the probes are least accessible; thus targets which preferentially bind to this region show more drastic
                  rate reductions than those that bind near the free end of the probe. The implications of these results for DNA-based biosensors
                  are discussed.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_nucleic_acids_asl05">Gold colloids are well known to display strong plasmon absorption bands due to electron oscillations induced by the incident
                  light. When the colloids are in proximity, the plasmon absorption bands are often perturbed. This has enabled us recently
                  to successfully develop a glucose sensing platform based on the disassociation of dextrancoated gold colloids, cross-linked
                  with Con A, by glucose. However, a much more useful and simpler property of gold colloids, which has been ill explored with
                  regard to sensing, is their ability to efficiently scatter excitation fight. We have found that our nanogold sensing aggregates
                  are indeed efficient light scatters around the nanogold plasmon absorption band. By measuring the ratio of scattered fight
                  intensities at two different arbitrary wavelengths, 560 and 680 nm, glucose concentrations can be readily determined from
                  a few millimolar up to similar to 60 mM, using a simple white light LED and detection system. Further, by measuring the ratio
                  of the scattered intensities, this sensing approach is independent of the total sensing aggregate concentration and the excitation
                  and detection instrumentation fluctuations or drifts. This simplistic and low-cost approach to glucose sensing, coupled with
                  the sensing aggreagates' ability to scatter red light, suggests the potential use of these aggregates for use in physiological
                  transdermal glucose monitoring, either for implantable skin sensors or glucose sensing tattoos (discussed later).

                  at the 5' ends with 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TMRh). The temperature and ionic strength of the solutions were varied
                  over large ranges. The results reveal at least three well-defined states of the TMRh-DNA molecules for the single-stranded
                  as well as for the double-stranded DNA molecules. Two states are fluorescent, with lifetimes in the range of 0.5-1 ns and
                  2.5-3 ns. A third state of TMRh-DNA does not fluoresce (a dark species of TMRh-DNA). The distribution of the TMRh-DNA molecules
                  among these three slates is strongly temperature and ionic strength dependent. Estimates are made of some reaction parameters

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_oligomers_fan03">Gold nanoparticles quench the fluorescence of cationic polyfluorene with Stern-Volmer constants (KSV) approaching 1011 M-1,
                  several orders of magnitude larger than any previously reported conjugated polymer-quencher pair and 9-10 orders of magnitude
                  larger than small molecule dye-quencher pairs. The dependence of KSV on ionic strength, charge and conjugation length of the
                  polymer, and the dimensions (and thus optical properties) of the nanoparticles suggests that three factors account for this
                  extraordinary efficiency: (i) amplification of the quenching via rapid internal energy or electron transfer, (ii) electrostatic
                  interactions between the cationic polymer and anionic nanoparticles, and (iii) the ability of gold nanoparticles to quench
                  via efficient energy transfer. As a result of this extraordinarily high KSV, quenching can be observed even at subpicomolar
                  concentrations of nanoparticles, suggesting that the combination of conjugated polymers with these nanomaterials can potentially
                  lead to improved sensitivity in optical biosensors.

                  a target polynucleotide is described. In this new nanoparticle-based detection system, Au particles (Â 13 nm diameter), which
                  are capped with 3'- and 5'-(alkanethiol)oligonucleotides, are used to complex a 24-base polynucleotide target. Hybridization
                  of the target with the probes results in the formation of an extended polymeric Au nanoparticle/polynucleotide aggregate,
                  which triggers a red to purple color change in solution. The color change is due to a red shift in the surface plasmon resonance
                  of the Au nanoparticles. The aggregates exhibit characteristic, exceptionally sharp "melting transitions" (monitored at 260
                  or 700 nm), which allows one to distinguish target sequences that contain one base end mismatches, deletions, or an insertion
                  from the fully complementary target. When test solutions are spotted onto a C18 reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography plate,
                  color differentiation is enhanced and a permanent record of the test is obtained, thereby providing a better method for distinguishing
                  the aforementioned target sequences. Significantly, one-pot colorimetric detection of the target in the presence of four strands

                  compiled from micrographs are used to compare assembly characteristics for each architecture. Asymmetric structures are also
                  produced in which both 5- and 10-nm Au particles are assembled on branched scaffolds.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_oligonucleotides_duh03">There is a keen interest in developing techniques for rapid genetic analysis that do not require labeling of an analyte. Here
                  we demonstrate that fluorophore-tagged DNA hairpins attached to gold films can function as immobilized "molecular beacons".
                  Two DNA hairpins incorporating portions of the Staphlococcus aureus FemA and mecR methicillin-resistance genes were attached
                  to a gold substrate. Upon exposure to the complement, a Â 26-fold increase in fluorescence intensity was measured corresponding
                  to a 96 Â± 5 quenching efficiency. Studies with nonspecific DNA indicate that DNA hairpins immobilized on a gold surface retain
                  their ability to bind complementary DNA sequences selectively.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_oligonucleotides_kne00">A method has been developed for highly sensitive detection of specific DNA sequences in a homogeneous assay using labeled
                  oligonucleotide molecules in combination with single-molecule photon burst counting and identification. The fluorescently
                  labeled oligonucleotides are called smart probes because they report the presence of complementary target sequences by a strong
                  increase in fluorescence intensity. The smart probes consist of a fluorescent dye attached at the terminus of a hairpin oligonucleotide.
                  The presented technique takes advantage of the fact that the used oxazine dye JA242 is efficiently quenched by complementary
                  guanosine residues. Upon specific hybridization to the target DNA, the smart probe undergoes a conformational change that
                  forces the fluorescent dye and the guanosine residues apart, thereby increasing the fluorescence intensity about six fold
                  in ensemble measurements. To increase the detection sensitivity below the nanomolar range, a confocal fluorescence microscope
                  was used to observe the fluorescence bursts from individual smart probes in the presence and absence of target DNA as they
                  passed through the focused laser beam. Smart probes were excited by a pulsed diode laser emitting at 635 nm with a repetition
                  rate of 64 MHz. Each fluorescence burst was identified by three independent parameters: (a) the burst size, (b) the burst
                  duration, and (c) the fluorescence lifetime. Through the use of this multiparameter analysis, higher discrimination accuracies
                  between smart probes and hybridized probe-target duplexes were achieved. The presented multiparameter detection technique
                  permits the identification of picomolar target DNA concentrations in a homogeneous assay, i.e., the detection of specific
                  DNA sequences in a 200-fold excess of labeled probe molecules.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_oligonucleotides_lij05">In this paper, we had proposed a silicon integrated circuit (IC) compatible DNA-detection platform using photodiode and ordinary
                  optical illumination to detect DNA hybridization events occurred on the chip surface. The method utilizes gold nanoparticle
                  labeling and silver enhancement to generate opaque surface at area with target DNA hybridization. A photodiode fabricated
                  underneath the supporting surface can then be used to detect the light intensity changes, before and after the silver enhancement.
                  With this technique, we have successfully discriminated single base-mismatched DNA from matched DNA sequence, and the detection
                  limit could be as low as 10 pM. By exploiting the advanced modern IC manufacturing technology and the well-established electrochemical
                  immobilization of DNA, this approach has the potential to be used to construct a portable high-density DNA nanoarray system

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_oligonucleotides_san03">Modifying colloidal gold particles with DNA is a new interesting approach in the development of genetic biosensors. Normally
                  the modification is designed to consist of a covalent gold-sulfur bond mediated by a thiol group on one end of a single-stranded
                  oligonucleotide. Here we investigate to what extent the binding actually consists of only the sulfur bridge or if some other
                  nonspecific binding mechanism is present as well. We report on an electrophoresis study showing high amounts of strong, non-thiol-mediated
                  (nonspecific) binding of both single- and double-stranded DNA to gold nanoparticles. Interestingly, even the double strands,
                  lacking interacting groups from the exposed bases of single-stranded DNA, interact nonspecifically with the gold particles.
                  We suggest the mechanism for this to be ion-induced dipole dispersive interactions, where the negatively charged phosphate
                  groups on the DNA induce dipoles in the highly polarizable gold particles. Moreover, we show that particles with nonspecifically
                  adsorbed DNA can be separated from the specifically modified and unmodified ones by gel electrophoresis.

                  biology. {T}raditional {F}Ã¶rster resonance energy transfer ({FRET}) is efficient for separation distances up to 100 {\AA}.
                  {W}e report the first successful application of a dipole-surface type energy transfer from a molecular dipole to a nanometal
                  surface that more than doubles the traditional {F}Ã¶rster range (220 {\AA}) and follows a 1/{R}4 distance dependence. {W}e

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_optical_microscopy_kra02">The optical near-field in the vicinity of a metal tip is mapped using a single-molecule optical probe. We observe an enhancement
                  of the fluorescence signal by a factor of 5.7Â±0.3, clearly larger than the fourfold enhancement that can arise from constructive
                  interference if the tip acts as a simple mirror. Considering the tip apex as a nanoparticle of nonregular shape, we suggest
                  that, in the case of gold tips, the enhancement is due to resonant plasmon excitation. Consistently, no enhancement has been
                  observed using Pt/Ir tips.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_optical_microscopy_soe00">We have developed a simple, fast, and flexible technique to measure optical scattering spectra of individual metallic nanoparticles.
                  The particles are placed in an evanescent field produced by total internal reflection of light from a halogen lamp in a glass
                  prism. The light scattered by individual particles is collected using a conventional microscope and is spectrally analyzed
                  by a nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled-device array coupled to a spectrometer. This technique is employed to measure the effect
                  of particle diameter on the dephasing time of the particle plasmon resonance in gold nanoparticles. We also demonstrate the
                  use of this technique for measurements in liquids, which is important for the potential application of particle plasmons in
                  chemical or biological nanosensors.

                  an electro-optical material such as a liquid crystal in order to induce a spectral shift of the particle plasmon resonance
                  by applying an electric field. Light scattering experiments on single gold nanoparticles show that spherically shaped nanoparticles
                  become optically spheroidal when covered by an anisotropic liquid crystal. The two particle plasmon resonances of the optically

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_optical_absorption_asl04a">Biotinylated gold nanoparticles were prepared by using a two-step surface modification procedure. First, a carboxyl-terminated
                  alkanethiol was chemisorbed onto the surface of gold nanoparticles in the presence of a stabilizing agent. Subsequently, the
                  carboxyl groups were reacted with (+)-biotinyl-3,6,9,-trioxaundecanediamine and 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol. This procedure resulted
                  in stable, ligand-modified gold nanoparticles. Upon interaction with streptavidin, the biotinylated gold nanoparticles aggregated
                  by means of specific biomolecular recognition. Their aggregation was studied by optical absorption spectroscopy. Controlled
                  aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles resulted in a shift in the surface plasmon resonance peak and broadening of
                  the absorption spectrum of the nanoparticles. The spectral changes were used to assess the extent of aggregation. Aggregation
                  was found to be dependent on the concentrations of streptavidin, biotinylated gold nanoparticles, and the surface mole fraction
                  of biotin groups on the nanoparticles. Maximum aggregation was observed when 24 nM streptavidin and 0.80 nM biotinylated gold
                  nanoparticles were used. Reversal of nanoparticle aggregation was accomplished by the addition of soluble biotin to the streptavidin-nanoparticle
                  aggregates. Kinetic analysis of the absorbance data showed that streptavidin-induced aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles
                  could be interpreted in terms of a Reaction-Limited Colloidal Aggregation (RLCA) model. This indicates that optical absorption
                  spectroscopy can provide a quantitative measurement of the aggregation process.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_optical_properties_asl05">Gold colloids are well known to display strong plasmon absorption bands due to electron oscillations induced by the incident
                  light. When the colloids are in proximity, the plasmon absorption bands are often perturbed. This has enabled us recently
                  to successfully develop a glucose sensing platform based on the disassociation of dextrancoated gold colloids, cross-linked
                  with Con A, by glucose. However, a much more useful and simpler property of gold colloids, which has been ill explored with
                  regard to sensing, is their ability to efficiently scatter excitation fight. We have found that our nanogold sensing aggregates
                  are indeed efficient light scatters around the nanogold plasmon absorption band. By measuring the ratio of scattered fight
                  intensities at two different arbitrary wavelengths, 560 and 680 nm, glucose concentrations can be readily determined from
                  a few millimolar up to similar to 60 mM, using a simple white light LED and detection system. Further, by measuring the ratio
                  of the scattered intensities, this sensing approach is independent of the total sensing aggregate concentration and the excitation
                  and detection instrumentation fluctuations or drifts. This simplistic and low-cost approach to glucose sensing, coupled with
                  the sensing aggreagates' ability to scatter red light, suggests the potential use of these aggregates for use in physiological
                  transdermal glucose monitoring, either for implantable skin sensors or glucose sensing tattoos (discussed later).

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_optical_properties_gou05">In this paper, the fabrication, characterization, and application of unique layer-by-layer (LBL) films of dendrimers and metallic
                  nanoparticles is reported. Silver nanoparticles (d = Â 20 nm) are produced in solution by sodium citrate reduction and incorporated
                  into thin films with generation 1 and 5 DAB-Am dendrimers (polypropylenimine dendrimers with amino surface groups) by the
                  LBL technique. The resulting nanocomposite films are characterized by UV-visible surface plasmon absorption and atomic force
                  microscopy (AFM) measurements, and employed as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of 2-naphthalenethiol.
                  Through variation of the molecular size (dendrimer generation) and concentration of the cross-linker used, as well as the
                  number of layers produced, the optical properties of several different possible architectures are studied. In the films, Ag
                  nanoparticles are shown to be effectively immobilized and stabilized with increased control over their spacing and aggregation.
                  Moreover, the films are shown to be excellent substrates for SERS measurements, demonstrating significant enhancement capability.
                  As expected, large electromagnetic enhancement of Raman scattering signals is found to be strongly dependent on interparticle
                  coupling between neighboring metallic nanoparticles. Finally, the possibility of detecting SERS signals from architectures
                  with intervening layers between the metal nanoparticles and analyte molecules is explored. It is shown that although there
                  are decreases in intensity with increasing number of intervening layers (as is expected from the distance dependence of SERS),
                  electromagnetic enhancement is still able to function at these distances, thus offering the possibility of developing sensors
                  with external layers that are chemically selective for specific analytes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_optical_properties_lea02">The linear absorption cross section is a crucial parameter to the design of nanocrystal quantum dot devices and to the interpretation
                  of spectroscopic data. We measure and report the size-dependent absorption cross section of CdSe nanocrystal quantum dots.
                  We compare the results for absorption far above the band edge, where the quantum dot density of states may be approximated
                  as a continuum, to simple theoretical models of light scattering from light-absorbing small particles. Excellent agreement
                  with theory is found for dilute dispersions in hexane. We find that for absorption at 350 nm the per particle absorption cross
                  section C-abs (in cm(2)) for CdSe is C-abs = (5.501 x 10(5))a(3) cm(-1), where a is the particle radius in cm. The absorption
                  cross section is observed to be largely insensitive to the solvent refractive index. Detailed modeling of the effect of the
                  ligand shell may be necessary to understand the lack of sensitivity of the absorption properties of nanocrystal quantum dots
                  to the refractive index of the medium.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_optical_properties_luy05">We present novel gold nanophotonic crescent moon structures with a sub-10 nm sharp edge, which can enhance local electromagnetic
                  field at the edge area. The formation of unconventional nanophotonic crescent moon structure is accomplished by using a sacrificial
                  nanosphere template and conventional thin film deposition method, which allows an effective batch nanofabrication and precise
                  controls of nanostructure shapes. Unique multiple scattering peaks are observed in a single gold nanocrescent moon with dark-field
                  white light illumination. A 785 nm near-infrared (NIR) diode laser was used as the excitation source to induce the amplified
                  scattering field on the sharp edge of the single gold nanocrescent moon. The Raman scattering spectrum of Rhodamine 6G molecules
                  adsorbed on the single gold nanocrescent moon are characterized, and the Raman enhancement factor of single gold nanocrescent
                  moon is estimated larger than 10(10), which suggests the potential applications of gold nanocrescent moons in ultrasensitive
                  biomolecular detection and cellular imaging using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_optical_properties_par03a">Due to their interesting properties, research on colloidal nanocrystals has moved in the last few years from fundamental research
                  to first applications in materials science and life sciences. In this review some recent biological applications of colloidal
                  nanocrystals are discussed, without going into biological or chemical details. First, the properties of colloidal nanocrystals
                  and how they can be synthesized are described. Second, the conjugation of nanocrystals with biological molecules is discussed.
                  And third, three different biological applications are introduced: (i) the arrangement of nanocrystal-oligonucleotide conjugates
                  using molecular scaffolds such as single-stranded DNA, (ii) the use of nanocrystal-protein conjugates as fluorescent probes
                  for cellular imaging, and (iii) a motility assay based on the uptake of nanocrystals by living cells.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_optical_properties_san03">Modifying colloidal gold particles with DNA is a new interesting approach in the development of genetic biosensors. Normally
                  the modification is designed to consist of a covalent gold-sulfur bond mediated by a thiol group on one end of a single-stranded
                  oligonucleotide. Here we investigate to what extent the binding actually consists of only the sulfur bridge or if some other
                  nonspecific binding mechanism is present as well. We report on an electrophoresis study showing high amounts of strong, non-thiol-mediated
                  (nonspecific) binding of both single- and double-stranded DNA to gold nanoparticles. Interestingly, even the double strands,
                  lacking interacting groups from the exposed bases of single-stranded DNA, interact nonspecifically with the gold particles.
                  We suggest the mechanism for this to be ion-induced dipole dispersive interactions, where the negatively charged phosphate
                  groups on the DNA induce dipoles in the highly polarizable gold particles. Moreover, we show that particles with nonspecifically
                  adsorbed DNA can be separated from the specifically modified and unmodified ones by gel electrophoresis.

                  of single biomolecules(1-4). However, such rulers suffer from low and fluctuating signal intensities, limited observation
                  time due to photobleaching, and an upper distance limit of similar to 10 nm. Noble metal nanoparticles have plasmon resonances
                  in the visible range and do not blink or bleach. They have been employed as alternative probes to overcome the limitations
                  of organic fluorophores(5,6), and the coupling of plasmons in nearby particles has been exploited to detect particle aggregation
                  by a distinct color change in bulk experiments(7-9). Here we demonstrate that plasmon coupling can be used to monitor distances
                  between single pairs of gold and silver nanoparticles. We followed the directed assembly of gold and silver nanoparticle dimers
                  in real time and studied the kinetics of single DNA hybridization events. These 'plasmon rulers' allowed us to continuously
                  monitor separations of up to 70 nm for &gt;3,000 s.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_optical_properties_str05">In this work we report on the so-called plasmonic enhancement effect, whereby the presence of metallic surfaces or particles
                  in the vicinity of a fluorophore can dramatically alter the fluorescence emission and absorption properties of a fluorophore.
                  The effect, which is associated with the surface plasmon resonance of the metallic surface, depends on parameters such as
                  metal type, particle size, fluorophore type, and fluorophore-particle separation. This work focuses on the creation of metal
                  nanoparticle arrays by a lithographic process and on optimisation strategies to maximise the fluorescence enhancement of dyes
                  in the vicinity of the nanoparticles, for important applications such as fluorescence-based biochip platforms. Ordered arrays
                  of metallic nano-islands were fabricated on glass substrates by a process of natural lithography using monodisperse polystyrene
                  nanospheres. The metal particle dimensions were tailored in order to tune the plasmon resonance wavelength to match the spectral
                  absorption of the fluorophore. The fluorophore, Cy5 dye, which is widely used in optical immunoassays and has a medium quantum
                  efficiency (similar to 0.3), was used in this preliminary study of the plasmonic enhancement effect. The morphology of the
                  metallic arrays was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Absorption and
                  emission spectroscopies were used to elucidate the enhancement effect and its dependence on metal island morphology. Results
                  were correlated with existing theoretical models. The applicability of this important technique to sensor platforms, such
                  as fluorescence-based biochips, is also discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_organic_compounds_cor03">We present a model for the evaluation of the metal-induced deexcitation rate for molecules close to a metal surface. In this
                  model, the molecule is treated quantum mechanically at the density-functional theory level and its excitations with a time-dependent
                  density-functional theory procedure. The metal is described through its dielectric response properties. The nonlocal features
                  of such a response are taken into account by using a modified Lindhard-Mermin dielectric constant. The presence of small random
                  roughness on the metal surface is described with the model of Rahman and Maradudin [Phys. Rev. B 21, 504 (1980)]. Systems
                  in which the molecule close to the metal is immersed in an homogeneous matrix or deposited on a spacer are considered. The
                  matrix and the spacer are treated with the polarizable continuum model. The molecule-metal and the molecule-matrix (or molecule-spacer)
                  electrostatic interactions are described by using the integral equation formalism, numerically treated with a boundary element
                  method. As a test case, the method has been applied to the study of phosphorescence from biacetyl close to a silver surface
                  and immersed in or deposited on solid ammonia. Our results show that nonlocal metal response and surface roughness have an
                  important role in explaining measured lifetimes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_oscillator_strength_lea02">The linear absorption cross section is a crucial parameter to the design of nanocrystal quantum dot devices and to the interpretation
                  of spectroscopic data. We measure and report the size-dependent absorption cross section of CdSe nanocrystal quantum dots.
                  We compare the results for absorption far above the band edge, where the quantum dot density of states may be approximated
                  as a continuum, to simple theoretical models of light scattering from light-absorbing small particles. Excellent agreement
                  with theory is found for dilute dispersions in hexane. We find that for absorption at 350 nm the per particle absorption cross
                  section C-abs (in cm(2)) for CdSe is C-abs = (5.501 x 10(5))a(3) cm(-1), where a is the particle radius in cm. The absorption
                  cross section is observed to be largely insensitive to the solvent refractive index. Detailed modeling of the effect of the
                  ligand shell may be necessary to understand the lack of sensitivity of the absorption properties of nanocrystal quantum dots
                  to the refractive index of the medium.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_particle_size_dul04">Light emission at the particle plasmon frequency is observed in optically excited spherical gold nanoparticles. We find a
                  photoluminescence efficiency of 10?6, which is essentially independent of particle size and four orders of magnitude higher
                  than the efficiencies determined from metal films. Our experimental findings are explained with a process in which excited
                  d-band holes recombine nonradiatively with sp electrons, emitting particle plasmons. These plasmons subsequently radiate,
                  giving rise to the photoluminescence observed in the experiment. We determine the quantum efficiencies involved in this process.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_particle_size_moc02">We present a systematic study of the effect of size and shape on the spectral response of individual silver nanoparticles.
                  An experimental method has been developed that begins with the detection and characterization of isolated nanoparticles in
                  the optical far field. The plasmon resonance optical spectrum of many individual nanoparticles are then correlated to their
                  size and shape using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We find that specific geometrical shapes give distinct
                  spectral responses. In addition, inducing subtle changes in the particles' morphology by heating causes a shift in the individual
                  particle spectrum and provides a simple means of tuning the spectral response to a desired optical wavelength. Improved colloidal
                  preparation methods could potentially lead to homogeneous populations of identical particle shapes and colors. These multicolor
                  colloids could be used as biological labels, surface enhanced Raman scattering substrates, or near field optical microscopy
                  sources covering the full range of wavelengths in the visible spectrum.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_particle_size_soe00">We have developed a simple, fast, and flexible technique to measure optical scattering spectra of individual metallic nanoparticles.
                  The particles are placed in an evanescent field produced by total internal reflection of light from a halogen lamp in a glass
                  prism. The light scattered by individual particles is collected using a conventional microscope and is spectrally analyzed
                  by a nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled-device array coupled to a spectrometer. This technique is employed to measure the effect
                  of particle diameter on the dephasing time of the particle plasmon resonance in gold nanoparticles. We also demonstrate the
                  use of this technique for measurements in liquids, which is important for the potential application of particle plasmons in
                  chemical or biological nanosensors.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_particles_bou05">Single two-dimensional planar silver arrays and one-dimensional linear gold chains of nanoparticles were investigated by dark-field
                  surface plasmon spectroscopy and studied as a function of interparticle distance, particle size, and number of particles.
                  In agreement with recent theoretical predictions, a red shift of the surface plasmon resonance occurring in two-dimensional
                  arrays was found for lattice spacings below 200 nm. This red shift is associated with a significant broadening of the resonance
                  and is attributed to the onset of near-field interactions. We found that the relative contributions of the long-range and
                  short-range interactions in two-dimensional arrays of particles are fundamentally different to those occurring in individual

                  for cylinders with irregular cross section, coupled structures, and periodic gratings are shown. These systems exhibit a resonant
                  behavior with complex field distribution and strong field enhancement, and therefore their computation requires a very accurate
                  numerical method. It is shown that the multiple multipole (MMP) method, together with an automatic multipole setting (AMS)
                  procedure, is well suited for these computations. An AMS technique for the two-dimensional MMP method is presented. It relies
                  on the global topology of each domain boundary to generate a distribution of numerically independent multipole expansions.
                  This technique greatly facilitates the MMP modeling.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_particles_ohe05">An inhibition assay method was developed based on the modulation in the FRET efficiency between quantum dots (QDs) and gold
                  nanoparticles (AuNPs) in the presence of the molecules which inhibit the interactions between QD- and AuNP-conjugated biomolecules.
                  For the functionalization, AuNPs were first stabilized by chemisorption of n-alkanethiols and then capped with the first generation
                  polyamidoamine (G1 PAMAM) dendrimers. By employing a streptavidin-biotin couple as a model system, avidin was quantitatively
                  analyzed as an inhibitor by sensing the change in photoluminescence (PL) quenching of SA-QDs by biotin-AuNPs. The detection
                  limit for avidin was about 10 nM. It is anticipated that the PL quenching-based sensing system can be used for the quantitative
                  analysis and high throughput screening of molecules which inhibit the specific biomolecular interactions.

                  possible to increase the radiative decay rate by three orders of magnitude while keeping a quantum efficiency larger than
                  80% in the near-infrared regime. We examine the competition between the radiative and nonradiative processes in the presence
                  of the antennae as a function of wavelength and antenna geometry. Our results hold great promise for improving the quantum

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_particles_son05">Forster Resonance Energy Transfer has served as a molecular ruler that reports conformational changes and intramolecular distances
                  of single biomolecules(1-4). However, such rulers suffer from low and fluctuating signal intensities, limited observation
                  time due to photobleaching, and an upper distance limit of similar to 10 nm. Noble metal nanoparticles have plasmon resonances
                  in the visible range and do not blink or bleach. They have been employed as alternative probes to overcome the limitations
                  of organic fluorophores(5,6), and the coupling of plasmons in nearby particles has been exploited to detect particle aggregation
                  by a distinct color change in bulk experiments(7-9). Here we demonstrate that plasmon coupling can be used to monitor distances
                  between single pairs of gold and silver nanoparticles. We followed the directed assembly of gold and silver nanoparticle dimers
                  in real time and studied the kinetics of single DNA hybridization events. These 'plasmon rulers' allowed us to continuously
                  monitor separations of up to 70 nm for &gt;3,000 s.

                  by using different mole ratios of silver nitrate/tiopronin. Ligands on the silver particles were partially displaced by fluorescein-labeled
                  thiolate single-stranded oligonucleotides or their complementary unlabeled oligonucleotides through ligand exchange. The fluorophores
                  on silver particles showed a surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF) dependent on the size of metallic cores. The particles could
                  be coupled through hybridizations of oligonucleotides bound on the particles. The coupled particles were aggregated due to
                  multiple displacements of oligonucleotides on each particle, resulting in stronger SEF. The dye-labeled oligonucleotides were
                  assembled on the silver islands on the solid substrate, and the complementary oligonucleotide-displaced particles were coupled
                  via oligonucleotide hybridization. The couplings between particles and islands resulted in an obvious fluorescence enhancement.

                  colloid containing Dy3+ were measured. For solution containing Dy3+, fluorescence emission occurs at visible light wavelength
                  region. Two emission peaks are observed at 480 nm and 570 nm respectively when the corresponding excitation wavelength is
                  at 350 nm. When An colloids were added to the solution containing Dy3+, both these two fluorescence peaks were enhanced. Furthermore,
                  with the increasing Au content, the fluorescence increases first and then decreases. We believe that this increased fluorescence

                  id="abstract_performance_liquid_chromatography_che04">For the first time, an aqueous solution of 32-nm gold nanoparticles (GNPs), to which Nile red (NR) has been noncovalently
                  adsorbed, has been used for sensing thiols. The as-prepared NRGNPs fluoresce weakly as a result of fluorescence resonance
                  energy transfer between NR and the GNPs. The fluorescence of a solution containing NRGNPs at pH 4.0 increases upon the addition
                  of thiols, but not when amines, acids, alcohols, bovine serum albumin, or hemoglobin are added. This phenomenon allows for
                  the selective determination of thiols such as cysteamine and homocysteine, which have limits of detection of 10.2 and 10.9
                  nM, respectively, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. Interestingly, we have found that the excitation (ex = 480 nm), emission
                  (em = 610 nm), and mass spectra (m/z 282) of the substance that desorbs from the GNPs in the presence of thiols are different
                  from those of NR (ex = 580 nm; em = 652 nm; m/z 318), which indicates that a new product forms. When simultaneously conducting
                  fluorescence and colorimetric assays, the selectivity of this approach further improves because at pH 4.0, the color of the
                  NRGNPs does not change in the presence of negatively charged thiols, (e.g., N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine), but changes from
                  maroon to purple and lavender in the presence of neutral thiols (e.g., 3-mercapto-1,2-propanediol) and positively charged
                  thiols (e.g., cysteamine), respectively, as a result of aggregation. This feature allows the types of thiols to be determined
                  at concentrations &gt;1.0 and 0.1 ÂµM by the naked eye and by UV-vis absorption, respectively. Depending on the rate at which
                  the NRGNP color changes, reduced glutathione (slow) is readily distinguishable from oxidized glutathione (no aggregation and
                  no displacement) and from cysteine and homocysteine (fast).

                  to first applications in materials science and life sciences. In this review some recent biological applications of colloidal
                  nanocrystals are discussed, without going into biological or chemical details. First, the properties of colloidal nanocrystals
                  and how they can be synthesized are described. Second, the conjugation of nanocrystals with biological molecules is discussed.
                  And third, three different biological applications are introduced: (i) the arrangement of nanocrystal-oligonucleotide conjugates
                  using molecular scaffolds such as single-stranded DNA, (ii) the use of nanocrystal-protein conjugates as fluorescent probes
                  for cellular imaging, and (iii) a motility assay based on the uptake of nanocrystals by living cells.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_phase_diagram_bon96">Molecular beacons are DNA probes that form a stem-and-loop structure and possess an internally quenched fluorophore. When
                  they bind to complementary nucleic acids, they undergo a conformational transition that switches on their fluorescence. These
                  probes recognize their targets with higher specificity than probes that cannot form a hairpin stem, and they easily discriminate
                  targets that differ from one another by only a single nucleotide. Our results show that molecular beacons can exist in three
                  different states: bound to a target, free in the form of a hairpin structure, and free in the form of a random coil. Thermodynamic
                  analysis of the transitions between these states reveals that enhanced specificity is a general feature of conformationally
                  constrained probes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none"
                  id="abstract_photobleaching_kinetics_ben05">Membrane topology of receptors plays an important role in shaping transmembrane signalling of cells. Among the methods used
                  for characterizing receptor clusters, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a donor and acceptor fluorophore plays
                  a unique role based on its capability of detecting molecular level (2-10 nm) proximities of receptors in physiological conditions.
                  Recent development of biotechnology has made possible the usage of colloidal gold particles in a large size range for specific
                  labelling of cells for the purposes of electron microscopy. However, by combining metal and fluorophore labelling or cells,
                  the versatility of metal-fluorophore interactions opens the way for new applications by detecting the presence of the metal
                  particles by the methods of fluorescence spectroscopy. An outstanding feature of the metal nanoparticle-fluorophore interaction
                  is that the metal particle can enhance spontaneous emission of the fluorophore in a distance-dependent fashion, in an interaction
                  range esentially determined by the size of the nanoparticle. In our work enhanced fluorescence of rhodamine and cyanine dyes
                  was observed in the vicinity of immunogold nanoparticles on the surface of JY cells in a flow cytometer. The dyes and the
                  immunogold were targetted to the cell surface receptors MHCI, MHCII, transferrin receptor and CD45 by monoclonal antibodies.
                  The fluorescence enhancement was sensitive to the wavelength of the exciting light, the size and amount of surface bound gold
                  beads, as well as the fluorophore-nanoparticle distance. The intensity of 90&amp;DEG; scattering of the incident light beam was
                  enhanced by the immunogold in a concentration and size-dependent fashion. The 90&amp;DEG; light scattering varied with the wavelength
                  of the incident light in a manner characteristic to gold nanoparticles of the applied sizes. A reduction in photobleaching
                  time constant of the cyanine dye was observed in the vicinity of gold particles in a digital imaging microscope. Modulations
                  of 90&amp;DEG; light scattering intensity and photobleaching time constant indicate the role of the local field in the fluorescence
                  enhancement. A mathematical simulation based on the electrodynamic theory of fluorescence enhancement showed a consistency
                  between the measured enhancement values, the inter-epitope distances and the quantum yields. The feasibility of realizing
                  proximity sensors operating at distance ranges larger than that of the conventional Forster transfer is demonstrated on the
                  surface of living cells. Copyright &amp;COPY; 2004 John Wiley&amp; Sons, Ltd.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_photocemistry_sau95">The increased sensitivity together with the advent of low-cost optical sources and detectors in the visible-near IR region
                  has led us to current efforts to develop new efficient fluorescent labels for biodiagnostics with absorption and emission
                  beyond 600 nm. In view of the general fluorescence decrease with increasing emission wavelength, we investigated the possibility
                  to shift the absorption of rhodamine dyes toward the region 620-670 nm. The hydrophobic nature of all known long-wavelength
                  dyes results in the tendency to form intra- and intermolecular aggregates in hydrophilic solvents, especially in aqueous environment.
                  Due to the aggregation with biological materials, fluorescence quenching of the dyes is often observed. New strategies for
                  prevention of these processes are considered.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_photochemistry_egg98">The photostability of fluorescent dyes is of crucial importance for the statistical accuracy of single-molecule detection
                  (SMD) and for the image quality of scanning confocal microscopy. Concurrent results for the photostability were obtained by
                  two different experimental techniques. First, the photostabilities of several coumarin and rhodamine derivatives in aqueous
                  solution were obtained by monitoring the steady-state fluorescence decay in a quartz cell. Furthermore, an epi-illuminated
                  microscope, continuous wave (CW) excitation at 514.5 nm, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with a newly developed
                  theory were used to study the photobleaching characteristics of rhodamines under conditions used for SMD. Depending on the
                  rhodamine structure, the probability of photobleaching, pb, is in the order of 10-6-10-7 for irradiances below 103 W/cm2.
                  However, a considerable increase of pb for irradiances above this level was observed which can only be described by photobleaching
                  reactions from higher excited states (two-step photolysis). In view of these observations, the probability of photobleaching,
                  pb, as well as a closed expression of its dependence on the CW excitation irradiance considering a five-level molecular electronic
                  state model with the possibility of photobleaching from higher excited electronic states, is derived. From this model, optimal
                  conditions for SMD with respect to the number of emitted fluorescence photons and to the signal-to-background ratio are discussed,
                  taking into account both saturation and photobleaching. The additional photobleaching due to two-step photolysis limits the
                  applicable irradiance.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_photochemistry_nor97">The increased sensitivity and the advantage of new lopw-cost optical sources and detectros in the red region creates a great
                  demand for new efficient fluorescence labels in this wavelength region. Here some problems arise due to the fact that with
                  increasing absorption wavelength the fluorescence quantum yield drastically decreases, especially in aqueous media. Additionally,
                  organic dyes may aggregate and show non-specific agginities to biological materials. We investigate the interactions of recently
                  developed fluorescent dyes and two commercially available fluorescent dyes with the DNA base guanosine. The results obtained
                  in intermolecular quenching experiments reveal various fluorescence quenching effects. Due to the increasing hydrophobicity
                  of fluorescent dyes with increasing molecular size the aggregation tendency with biological materials also increases. Therefore
                  ground and excited state interactions increase thus promoting the observed fluorescence quenching.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_photochromism_hei05">We demonstrate that commercially available unmodified carbocyanine dyes such as Cy5 (usually excited at 633 nm) can be used
                  as efficient reversible single-molecule optical switch, whose fluorescent state after apparent photobleaching can be restored
                  at room temperature upon irradiation at shorter wavelengths. Ensemble photobleaching and recovery experiments of Cy5 in aqueous
                  solution irradiating first at 633 nm, then at 337, 488, or 532 nm, demonstrate that restoration of absorption and fluorescence
                  strongly depends on efficient oxygen removal and the addition of the triplet quencher -mercaptoethylamine. Single-molecule
                  fluorescence experiments show that individual immobilized Cy5 molecules can be switched optically in milliseconds by applying
                  alternating excitation at 633 and 488 nm between a fluorescent and nonfluorescent state up to 100 times with a reliability
                  of &gt;90% at room temperature. Because of their intriguing performance, carbocyanine dyes volunteer as a simple alternative
                  for ultrahigh-density optical data storage. Measurements on single donor/acceptor (tetramethylrhodamine/Cy5) labeled oligonucleotides
                  point out that the described light-driven switching behavior imposes fundamental limitations on the use of carbocyanine dyes
                  as energy transfer acceptors for the study of biological processes.

                  than the efficiencies determined from metal films. Our experimental findings are explained with a process in which excited

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_photoluminescence_dul04">Light emission at the particle plasmon frequency is observed in optically excited spherical gold nanoparticles. We find a
                  photoluminescence efficiency of 10?6, which is essentially independent of particle size and four orders of magnitude higher
                  than the efficiencies determined from metal films. Our experimental findings are explained with a process in which excited
                  d-band holes recombine nonradiatively with sp electrons, emitting particle plasmons. These plasmons subsequently radiate,
                  giving rise to the photoluminescence observed in the experiment. We determine the quantum efficiencies involved in this process.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_photoluminescence_fan03">Gold nanoparticles quench the fluorescence of cationic polyfluorene with Stern-Volmer constants (KSV) approaching 1011 M-1,
                  several orders of magnitude larger than any previously reported conjugated polymer-quencher pair and 9-10 orders of magnitude
                  larger than small molecule dye-quencher pairs. The dependence of KSV on ionic strength, charge and conjugation length of the
                  polymer, and the dimensions (and thus optical properties) of the nanoparticles suggests that three factors account for this
                  extraordinary efficiency: (i) amplification of the quenching via rapid internal energy or electron transfer, (ii) electrostatic
                  interactions between the cationic polymer and anionic nanoparticles, and (iii) the ability of gold nanoparticles to quench
                  via efficient energy transfer. As a result of this extraordinarily high KSV, quenching can be observed even at subpicomolar
                  concentrations of nanoparticles, suggesting that the combination of conjugated polymers with these nanomaterials can potentially
                  lead to improved sensitivity in optical biosensors.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_photoluminescence_far05">The interaction of a single quantum dot with a bowtie antenna is demonstrated for visible light. The antenna is generated
                  at the apex of a Si3N4 atomic force microscopy tip by focused ion beam milling. When scanned over the quantum dot, its photoluminescence
                  is enhanced while its excited-state lifetime is decreased. Our observations demonstrate that the relaxation channels of a
                  single quantum emitter can be controlled by coupling to an efficiently radiating metallic nanoantenna.

                  used spectral analogues listed above. In addition, Alexa dyes are insensitive to pH in the 4-10 range. We evaluated Alexa

                  streptavidin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and concanavalin A (ConA). Conjugates of Alexa 546 are at least twofold more fluo-rescent

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_photothermal_effects_ber04">We introduce a new, highly sensitive, and simple heterodyne optical method for imaging individual nonfluorescent nanoclusters
                  and nanocrystals. A 2 order of magnitude improvement of the signal is achieved compared to previous methods. This allows for
                  the unprecedented detection of individual small absorptive objects such as metallic clusters (of 67 atoms) or nonluminescent
                  semiconductor nanocrystals. The measured signals are in agreement with a calculation based on the scattering field theory
                  from a photothermal-induced modulated index of refraction profile around the nanoparticle.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_plasma_che04">For the first time, an aqueous solution of 32-nm gold nanoparticles (GNPs), to which Nile red (NR) has been noncovalently
                  adsorbed, has been used for sensing thiols. The as-prepared NRGNPs fluoresce weakly as a result of fluorescence resonance
                  energy transfer between NR and the GNPs. The fluorescence of a solution containing NRGNPs at pH 4.0 increases upon the addition
                  of thiols, but not when amines, acids, alcohols, bovine serum albumin, or hemoglobin are added. This phenomenon allows for
                  the selective determination of thiols such as cysteamine and homocysteine, which have limits of detection of 10.2 and 10.9
                  nM, respectively, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. Interestingly, we have found that the excitation (ex = 480 nm), emission
                  (em = 610 nm), and mass spectra (m/z 282) of the substance that desorbs from the GNPs in the presence of thiols are different
                  from those of NR (ex = 580 nm; em = 652 nm; m/z 318), which indicates that a new product forms. When simultaneously conducting
                  fluorescence and colorimetric assays, the selectivity of this approach further improves because at pH 4.0, the color of the
                  NRGNPs does not change in the presence of negatively charged thiols, (e.g., N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine), but changes from
                  maroon to purple and lavender in the presence of neutral thiols (e.g., 3-mercapto-1,2-propanediol) and positively charged
                  thiols (e.g., cysteamine), respectively, as a result of aggregation. This feature allows the types of thiols to be determined
                  at concentrations &gt;1.0 and 0.1 ÂµM by the naked eye and by UV-vis absorption, respectively. Depending on the rate at which
                  the NRGNP color changes, reduced glutathione (slow) is readily distinguishable from oxidized glutathione (no aggregation and
                  no displacement) and from cysteine and homocysteine (fast).

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_plasma_membrane_ben05">Membrane topology of receptors plays an important role in shaping transmembrane signalling of cells. Among the methods used
                  for characterizing receptor clusters, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a donor and acceptor fluorophore plays
                  a unique role based on its capability of detecting molecular level (2-10 nm) proximities of receptors in physiological conditions.
                  Recent development of biotechnology has made possible the usage of colloidal gold particles in a large size range for specific
                  labelling of cells for the purposes of electron microscopy. However, by combining metal and fluorophore labelling or cells,
                  the versatility of metal-fluorophore interactions opens the way for new applications by detecting the presence of the metal
                  particles by the methods of fluorescence spectroscopy. An outstanding feature of the metal nanoparticle-fluorophore interaction
                  is that the metal particle can enhance spontaneous emission of the fluorophore in a distance-dependent fashion, in an interaction
                  range esentially determined by the size of the nanoparticle. In our work enhanced fluorescence of rhodamine and cyanine dyes
                  was observed in the vicinity of immunogold nanoparticles on the surface of JY cells in a flow cytometer. The dyes and the
                  immunogold were targetted to the cell surface receptors MHCI, MHCII, transferrin receptor and CD45 by monoclonal antibodies.
                  The fluorescence enhancement was sensitive to the wavelength of the exciting light, the size and amount of surface bound gold
                  beads, as well as the fluorophore-nanoparticle distance. The intensity of 90&amp;DEG; scattering of the incident light beam was
                  enhanced by the immunogold in a concentration and size-dependent fashion. The 90&amp;DEG; light scattering varied with the wavelength
                  of the incident light in a manner characteristic to gold nanoparticles of the applied sizes. A reduction in photobleaching
                  time constant of the cyanine dye was observed in the vicinity of gold particles in a digital imaging microscope. Modulations
                  of 90&amp;DEG; light scattering intensity and photobleaching time constant indicate the role of the local field in the fluorescence
                  enhancement. A mathematical simulation based on the electrodynamic theory of fluorescence enhancement showed a consistency
                  between the measured enhancement values, the inter-epitope distances and the quantum yields. The feasibility of realizing
                  proximity sensors operating at distance ranges larger than that of the conventional Forster transfer is demonstrated on the
                  surface of living cells. Copyright &amp;COPY; 2004 John Wiley&amp; Sons, Ltd.

                  id="abstract_plasmon_resonance_biosensor_sey05">Efforts to improve the performance of immunoassays and immunosensors by incorporating different kinds of nanostructures have
                  gained considerable momentum over the last decade. Apart from liposomes, which will not be discussed here, most groups focus
                  on artificial, particulate marker systems, both organic and inorganic. The underlying detection procedures may be based either
                  on electro-magnetical or optical techniques. This review will be confined to the latter only, comprising nanoparticle applications
                  generating signals as diverse as static and time-resolved luminescence, one- and two-photon absorption, Raman and Rayleigh
                  scattering as well as surface plasmon resonance and others. In general, all endeavors cited are geared to achieve one or more
                  of the following goals: lowering of detection limits (if possible, down to single-molecule level), parallel integration of
                  multiple signals (multiplexing), signal amplification by several orders of magnitude and prevention of photobleaching effects
                  with concomitant maintenance of antigen binding specificity and sensitivity. Inorganic nanoparticle labels based on noble
                  metals, semiconductor quantum dots and nanoshells appear to be the most versatile systems for these bioanalytical applications

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_plasmons_bla04">The spontaneous emission of an excited atom surrounded by different materials is studied in the framework of a semiclassical
                  approach, where the transition dipole moment acts as the source of the emission field. The emission in the presence of semiinfinite
                  media, metallic nanorings, spheres, gratings, and other complex geometries is investigated. Strong emission enhancement effects
                  are obtained in some of these geometries associated to the excitation of plasmons (e.g., in nanorings or spheres). Furthermore,
                  the emission is shown to take place only along narrow angular distributions when the atom is located inside a low-index dielectric
                  and near its planar surface, or when metallic nanogratings are employed at certain resonant wave lengths. In particular, axially
                  symmetric gratings made of real silver metal are considered, and both emission rate enhancement and focused far-field emission
                  are achieved simultaneously when the grating is decorated with further nanostructures.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_plasmons_bra05">We extend the plasmon hybridization method to investigate the plasmon modes of metallic nanoshell dimers. The formalism is
                  also generalized to include the effects of dielectric backgrounds. It is shown that the presence of dielectrics shifts the
                  plasmon resonances of the individual nanoparticles to lower energies and screens their interaction in the dimer configuration.
                  The net result is a redshift of dimer energies compared to the system without dielectrics and a weaker dependence of the dimer
                  plasmon energies on dimer separation. We calculate the plasmon energies and optical absorption of nanoshell dimers as a function
                  of dimer separation. The results are in excellent agreement with the results of finite difference time domain simulations.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_plasmons_dul04">Light emission at the particle plasmon frequency is observed in optically excited spherical gold nanoparticles. We find a
                  photoluminescence efficiency of 10?6, which is essentially independent of particle size and four orders of magnitude higher
                  than the efficiencies determined from metal films. Our experimental findings are explained with a process in which excited
                  d-band holes recombine nonradiatively with sp electrons, emitting particle plasmons. These plasmons subsequently radiate,
                  giving rise to the photoluminescence observed in the experiment. We determine the quantum efficiencies involved in this process.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_plasmons_mer07">We present a theoretical study of the modifications of the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of an optical emitter in
                  close proximity to a noble-metal nanosphere, based on exact electrodynamical theory. We show that the optimal nanosphere diameter
                  for luminescence quantum efficiency enhancement associated with resonant coupling to plasmon modes is in the range of 30-110
                  nm, depending on the material properties. The optimal diameter is found to be a trade-off between (1) emitter-plasmon coupling,
                  which is most effective for small spheres, and (2) the outcoupling of plasmons into radiation, which is most efficient for
                  large spheres. In addition, we show that the well-known Gersten and Nitzan model does not describe the existence of a finite
                  optimal diameter unless the model is extended with the correction factor for radiation damping. With this correction and a
                  correction for dynamic depolarization, the mathematically simpler Gersten and Nitzan model provides a reasonably accurate
                  approximation of the decay rate modifications associated with coupling to the dipole plasmon mode. We anticipate that the
                  Gersten and Nitzan model in the form that we validate in this paper for spheres will allow the analytical investigation of
                  the influence of shape anisotropy on plasmon-enhanced luminescence.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_plasmons_moc02">We present a systematic study of the effect of size and shape on the spectral response of individual silver nanoparticles.
                  An experimental method has been developed that begins with the detection and characterization of isolated nanoparticles in
                  the optical far field. The plasmon resonance optical spectrum of many individual nanoparticles are then correlated to their
                  size and shape using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We find that specific geometrical shapes give distinct
                  spectral responses. In addition, inducing subtle changes in the particles' morphology by heating causes a shift in the individual
                  particle spectrum and provides a simple means of tuning the spectral response to a desired optical wavelength. Improved colloidal
                  preparation methods could potentially lead to homogeneous populations of identical particle shapes and colors. These multicolor
                  colloids could be used as biological labels, surface enhanced Raman scattering substrates, or near field optical microscopy
                  sources covering the full range of wavelengths in the visible spectrum.

                  by applying an electric field. Light scattering experiments on single gold nanoparticles show that spherically shaped nanoparticles

                  id="abstract_poly_amidoamine__dendrimers_gou05">In this paper, the fabrication, characterization, and application of unique layer-by-layer (LBL) films of dendrimers and metallic
                  nanoparticles is reported. Silver nanoparticles (d = Â 20 nm) are produced in solution by sodium citrate reduction and incorporated
                  into thin films with generation 1 and 5 DAB-Am dendrimers (polypropylenimine dendrimers with amino surface groups) by the
                  LBL technique. The resulting nanocomposite films are characterized by UV-visible surface plasmon absorption and atomic force
                  microscopy (AFM) measurements, and employed as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of 2-naphthalenethiol.
                  Through variation of the molecular size (dendrimer generation) and concentration of the cross-linker used, as well as the
                  number of layers produced, the optical properties of several different possible architectures are studied. In the films, Ag
                  nanoparticles are shown to be effectively immobilized and stabilized with increased control over their spacing and aggregation.
                  Moreover, the films are shown to be excellent substrates for SERS measurements, demonstrating significant enhancement capability.
                  As expected, large electromagnetic enhancement of Raman scattering signals is found to be strongly dependent on interparticle
                  coupling between neighboring metallic nanoparticles. Finally, the possibility of detecting SERS signals from architectures
                  with intervening layers between the metal nanoparticles and analyte molecules is explored. It is shown that although there
                  are decreases in intensity with increasing number of intervening layers (as is expected from the distance dependence of SERS),
                  electromagnetic enhancement is still able to function at these distances, thus offering the possibility of developing sensors
                  with external layers that are chemically selective for specific analytes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_polyelectrolyte_fan03">Gold nanoparticles quench the fluorescence of cationic polyfluorene with Stern-Volmer constants (KSV) approaching 1011 M-1,
                  several orders of magnitude larger than any previously reported conjugated polymer-quencher pair and 9-10 orders of magnitude
                  larger than small molecule dye-quencher pairs. The dependence of KSV on ionic strength, charge and conjugation length of the
                  polymer, and the dimensions (and thus optical properties) of the nanoparticles suggests that three factors account for this
                  extraordinary efficiency: (i) amplification of the quenching via rapid internal energy or electron transfer, (ii) electrostatic
                  interactions between the cationic polymer and anionic nanoparticles, and (iii) the ability of gold nanoparticles to quench
                  via efficient energy transfer. As a result of this extraordinarily high KSV, quenching can be observed even at subpicomolar
                  concentrations of nanoparticles, suggesting that the combination of conjugated polymers with these nanomaterials can potentially
                  lead to improved sensitivity in optical biosensors.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_polynucleotides_asl04a">Biotinylated gold nanoparticles were prepared by using a two-step surface modification procedure. First, a carboxyl-terminated
                  alkanethiol was chemisorbed onto the surface of gold nanoparticles in the presence of a stabilizing agent. Subsequently, the
                  carboxyl groups were reacted with (+)-biotinyl-3,6,9,-trioxaundecanediamine and 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol. This procedure resulted
                  in stable, ligand-modified gold nanoparticles. Upon interaction with streptavidin, the biotinylated gold nanoparticles aggregated
                  by means of specific biomolecular recognition. Their aggregation was studied by optical absorption spectroscopy. Controlled
                  aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles resulted in a shift in the surface plasmon resonance peak and broadening of
                  the absorption spectrum of the nanoparticles. The spectral changes were used to assess the extent of aggregation. Aggregation
                  was found to be dependent on the concentrations of streptavidin, biotinylated gold nanoparticles, and the surface mole fraction
                  of biotin groups on the nanoparticles. Maximum aggregation was observed when 24 nM streptavidin and 0.80 nM biotinylated gold
                  nanoparticles were used. Reversal of nanoparticle aggregation was accomplished by the addition of soluble biotin to the streptavidin-nanoparticle
                  aggregates. Kinetic analysis of the absorbance data showed that streptavidin-induced aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles
                  could be interpreted in terms of a Reaction-Limited Colloidal Aggregation (RLCA) model. This indicates that optical absorption
                  spectroscopy can provide a quantitative measurement of the aggregation process.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_polynucleotides_che04">For the first time, an aqueous solution of 32-nm gold nanoparticles (GNPs), to which Nile red (NR) has been noncovalently
                  adsorbed, has been used for sensing thiols. The as-prepared NRGNPs fluoresce weakly as a result of fluorescence resonance
                  energy transfer between NR and the GNPs. The fluorescence of a solution containing NRGNPs at pH 4.0 increases upon the addition
                  of thiols, but not when amines, acids, alcohols, bovine serum albumin, or hemoglobin are added. This phenomenon allows for
                  the selective determination of thiols such as cysteamine and homocysteine, which have limits of detection of 10.2 and 10.9
                  nM, respectively, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. Interestingly, we have found that the excitation (ex = 480 nm), emission
                  (em = 610 nm), and mass spectra (m/z 282) of the substance that desorbs from the GNPs in the presence of thiols are different
                  from those of NR (ex = 580 nm; em = 652 nm; m/z 318), which indicates that a new product forms. When simultaneously conducting
                  fluorescence and colorimetric assays, the selectivity of this approach further improves because at pH 4.0, the color of the
                  NRGNPs does not change in the presence of negatively charged thiols, (e.g., N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine), but changes from
                  maroon to purple and lavender in the presence of neutral thiols (e.g., 3-mercapto-1,2-propanediol) and positively charged
                  thiols (e.g., cysteamine), respectively, as a result of aggregation. This feature allows the types of thiols to be determined
                  at concentrations &gt;1.0 and 0.1 ÂµM by the naked eye and by UV-vis absorption, respectively. Depending on the rate at which
                  the NRGNP color changes, reduced glutathione (slow) is readily distinguishable from oxidized glutathione (no aggregation and
                  no displacement) and from cysteine and homocysteine (fast).

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_polynucleotides_san03">Modifying colloidal gold particles with DNA is a new interesting approach in the development of genetic biosensors. Normally
                  the modification is designed to consist of a covalent gold-sulfur bond mediated by a thiol group on one end of a single-stranded
                  oligonucleotide. Here we investigate to what extent the binding actually consists of only the sulfur bridge or if some other
                  nonspecific binding mechanism is present as well. We report on an electrophoresis study showing high amounts of strong, non-thiol-mediated
                  (nonspecific) binding of both single- and double-stranded DNA to gold nanoparticles. Interestingly, even the double strands,
                  lacking interacting groups from the exposed bases of single-stranded DNA, interact nonspecifically with the gold particles.
                  We suggest the mechanism for this to be ion-induced dipole dispersive interactions, where the negatively charged phosphate
                  groups on the DNA induce dipoles in the highly polarizable gold particles. Moreover, we show that particles with nonspecifically
                  adsorbed DNA can be separated from the specifically modified and unmodified ones by gel electrophoresis.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_polynucleotides_sto02">The binding affinity of deoxynucleosides (dA, dG, dC, and dT) to gold nanoparticles was studied using a colorimetric assay
                  to determine if nucleobase sequence may play a role in binding alkanethiol-capped oligonucleotides to gold nanoparticles.
                  These data indicate that the deoxynucleoside dT has a much lower binding affinity to the gold nanoparticle surface than the
                  deoxynucleosides dG, dC, and dA. These data can be correlated with a previous study in our lab which indicated that alkanethiol-capped
                  oligonucleotides containing (dT)20 spacers have a significantly higher surface coverage than oligonucleotides containing (dA)20
                  spacers. To probe the physical consequences of this phenomenon, gold nanoparticles were loaded with alkanethiol-capped poly
                  dT, dA, and dC oligonucleotide sequences of 5-20 bases in length, and the stabilities of the particles in electrolytic media
                  were measured by monitoring a colorimetric change associated with particle agglomeration. The gold nanoparticles loaded with
                  alkanethiol-capped poly dT oligonucleotides exhibited a dramatic increase in stability as the oligonucleotide length was increased
                  from 5 to 20 bases. By comparison, gold nanoparticles loaded with poly dC and poly dA sequences exhibited only a slight increase
                  in stability as the oligonucleotide length was increased. The sequence-dependent stability observed for the DNA-modified gold
                  nanoparticles is attributed to the weaker interaction of the deoxynucleoside dT with the gold nanoparticle surface which results
                  in higher surface coverages and consequently enhanced stability as the oligonucleotide length is increased.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_pore_size_ack62">A gel-diffusion technique in which transport occurs across a thin agar membrane has been devised. This technique was used
                  for pore-size calibration of a series of agar gels of various concentrations by measurement of hindrance to diffusion of human
                  hemoglobin and southern bean mosaic virus particles. Pore radii calculated from independent restricted diffusion measurements
                  of these two particle-species by use of a theoretical equation of were in very good agreement, and show that this equation
                  provides a close approximation to the diffusional restriction occurring in these systems. Values of restricted diffusion coefficients
                  in gels of various pore sizes were obtained from restricted diffusion measurements of four other proteins (rabbit [gamma]-globulin,
                  human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, and pancreatic ribonuclease). When these coefficients were extrapolated to conditions
                  of infinite pore size (zero gel concentration) the values obtained agreed generally with reported values of the free diffusion
                  coefficients for these proteins. Sharp differentiation in diffusional restriction on the basis of particle size and shape
                  was demonstrated.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_probe_egg98">The photostability of fluorescent dyes is of crucial importance for the statistical accuracy of single-molecule detection
                  (SMD) and for the image quality of scanning confocal microscopy. Concurrent results for the photostability were obtained by
                  two different experimental techniques. First, the photostabilities of several coumarin and rhodamine derivatives in aqueous
                  solution were obtained by monitoring the steady-state fluorescence decay in a quartz cell. Furthermore, an epi-illuminated
                  microscope, continuous wave (CW) excitation at 514.5 nm, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with a newly developed
                  theory were used to study the photobleaching characteristics of rhodamines under conditions used for SMD. Depending on the
                  rhodamine structure, the probability of photobleaching, pb, is in the order of 10-6-10-7 for irradiances below 103 W/cm2.
                  However, a considerable increase of pb for irradiances above this level was observed which can only be described by photobleaching
                  reactions from higher excited states (two-step photolysis). In view of these observations, the probability of photobleaching,
                  pb, as well as a closed expression of its dependence on the CW excitation irradiance considering a five-level molecular electronic
                  state model with the possibility of photobleaching from higher excited electronic states, is derived. From this model, optimal
                  conditions for SMD with respect to the number of emitted fluorescence photons and to the signal-to-background ratio are discussed,
                  taking into account both saturation and photobleaching. The additional photobleaching due to two-step photolysis limits the
                  applicable irradiance.

                  we demonstrate that fluorophore-tagged DNA hairpins attached to gold films can function as immobilized "molecular beacons".
                  Two DNA hairpins incorporating portions of the Staphlococcus aureus FemA and mecR methicillin-resistance genes were attached
                  to a gold substrate. Upon exposure to the complement, a Â 26-fold increase in fluorescence intensity was measured corresponding
                  to a 96 Â± 5 quenching efficiency. Studies with nonspecific DNA indicate that DNA hairpins immobilized on a gold surface retain
                  their ability to bind complementary DNA sequences selectively.

                  and rate equation formalisms, we show that, for surface coverages at which the surface immobilized molecules interact, barriers
                  to penetration create a distribution of target molecule concentrations within the adsorbed layer. By approximately enumerating
                  probe and target conformations, we estimate the probability of overlap between complementary probe and target regions as a
                  function of probe density and chain length. In agreement with experiments, we find that as probe molecules interact more strongly,
                  fewer nucleation sites become accessible and binding rates are diminished relative to those in solution. Nucleation sites
                  near the grafted end of the probes are least accessible; thus targets which preferentially bind to this region show more drastic
                  rate reductions than those that bind near the free end of the probe. The implications of these results for DNA-based biosensors

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_probes_mar03">Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements were performed to elucidate the fluorescence quenching of oxazine,
                  rhodamine, carbocyanine, and bora-diaza-indacene dyes by amino acids. Among the natural amino acids, tryptophan exhibits the
                  most pronounced quenching efficiency. Especially, the red-absorbing dyes ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine derivative MR
                  121 are strongly quenched almost exclusively by tryptophan due to the formation of weak or nonfluorescent ground-state complexes
                  with association constants, Kass., ranging from 96 to 206 M-1. Rhodamine, fluorescein, and bora-diaza-indacene derivatives
                  that absorb at shorter wavelengths are also quenched substantially by tyrosine residues. The quenching of carbocyanine dyes,
                  such as Cy5, and Alexa 647 by amino acids can be almost neglected. While quenching of ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine
                  derivative MR121 by tryptophan is dominated by static quenching, dynamic quenching is more efficient for the two bora-diaza-indacene
                  dyes Bodipy-FL and Bodipy630/650. Labeling of the dyes to tryptophan, tryptophan-containing peptides, and proteins (streptavidin)
                  demonstrates that knowledge of these fluorescence quenching processes is crucial for the development of fluorescence-based
                  diagnostic assays. Changes in the fluorescence quantum yield of dye-labeled peptides and proteins might be used advantageously
                  for the quantification of proteases and specific binding partners.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_probes_san03">Modifying colloidal gold particles with DNA is a new interesting approach in the development of genetic biosensors. Normally
                  the modification is designed to consist of a covalent gold-sulfur bond mediated by a thiol group on one end of a single-stranded
                  oligonucleotide. Here we investigate to what extent the binding actually consists of only the sulfur bridge or if some other
                  nonspecific binding mechanism is present as well. We report on an electrophoresis study showing high amounts of strong, non-thiol-mediated
                  (nonspecific) binding of both single- and double-stranded DNA to gold nanoparticles. Interestingly, even the double strands,
                  lacking interacting groups from the exposed bases of single-stranded DNA, interact nonspecifically with the gold particles.
                  We suggest the mechanism for this to be ion-induced dipole dispersive interactions, where the negatively charged phosphate
                  groups on the DNA induce dipoles in the highly polarizable gold particles. Moreover, we show that particles with nonspecifically
                  adsorbed DNA can be separated from the specifically modified and unmodified ones by gel electrophoresis.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_probes_son05">Forster Resonance Energy Transfer has served as a molecular ruler that reports conformational changes and intramolecular distances
                  of single biomolecules(1-4). However, such rulers suffer from low and fluctuating signal intensities, limited observation
                  time due to photobleaching, and an upper distance limit of similar to 10 nm. Noble metal nanoparticles have plasmon resonances
                  in the visible range and do not blink or bleach. They have been employed as alternative probes to overcome the limitations
                  of organic fluorophores(5,6), and the coupling of plasmons in nearby particles has been exploited to detect particle aggregation
                  by a distinct color change in bulk experiments(7-9). Here we demonstrate that plasmon coupling can be used to monitor distances
                  between single pairs of gold and silver nanoparticles. We followed the directed assembly of gold and silver nanoparticle dimers
                  in real time and studied the kinetics of single DNA hybridization events. These 'plasmon rulers' allowed us to continuously
                  monitor separations of up to 70 nm for &gt;3,000 s.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_probes_sto02">The binding affinity of deoxynucleosides (dA, dG, dC, and dT) to gold nanoparticles was studied using a colorimetric assay
                  to determine if nucleobase sequence may play a role in binding alkanethiol-capped oligonucleotides to gold nanoparticles.
                  These data indicate that the deoxynucleoside dT has a much lower binding affinity to the gold nanoparticle surface than the
                  deoxynucleosides dG, dC, and dA. These data can be correlated with a previous study in our lab which indicated that alkanethiol-capped
                  oligonucleotides containing (dT)20 spacers have a significantly higher surface coverage than oligonucleotides containing (dA)20
                  spacers. To probe the physical consequences of this phenomenon, gold nanoparticles were loaded with alkanethiol-capped poly
                  dT, dA, and dC oligonucleotide sequences of 5-20 bases in length, and the stabilities of the particles in electrolytic media
                  were measured by monitoring a colorimetric change associated with particle agglomeration. The gold nanoparticles loaded with
                  alkanethiol-capped poly dT oligonucleotides exhibited a dramatic increase in stability as the oligonucleotide length was increased
                  from 5 to 20 bases. By comparison, gold nanoparticles loaded with poly dC and poly dA sequences exhibited only a slight increase
                  in stability as the oligonucleotide length was increased. The sequence-dependent stability observed for the DNA-modified gold
                  nanoparticles is attributed to the weaker interaction of the deoxynucleoside dT with the gold nanoparticle surface which results
                  in higher surface coverages and consequently enhanced stability as the oligonucleotide length is increased.

                  id="abstract_prostate_specific_antigen_sey05">Efforts to improve the performance of immunoassays and immunosensors by incorporating different kinds of nanostructures have
                  gained considerable momentum over the last decade. Apart from liposomes, which will not be discussed here, most groups focus
                  on artificial, particulate marker systems, both organic and inorganic. The underlying detection procedures may be based either
                  on electro-magnetical or optical techniques. This review will be confined to the latter only, comprising nanoparticle applications
                  generating signals as diverse as static and time-resolved luminescence, one- and two-photon absorption, Raman and Rayleigh
                  scattering as well as surface plasmon resonance and others. In general, all endeavors cited are geared to achieve one or more
                  of the following goals: lowering of detection limits (if possible, down to single-molecule level), parallel integration of
                  multiple signals (multiplexing), signal amplification by several orders of magnitude and prevention of photobleaching effects
                  with concomitant maintenance of antigen binding specificity and sensitivity. Inorganic nanoparticle labels based on noble
                  metals, semiconductor quantum dots and nanoshells appear to be the most versatile systems for these bioanalytical applications
                  of nanophotonics. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

                  id="abstract_protected_gold_clusters_kam02a">Unique electronic and chemical properties of metal nanoparticles have drawn the attention of chemists, physicists, biologists,
                  and engineers who wish to use them for the development of new generation nanodevices. Metal nanoparticles such as gold and
                  silver show noticeable photoactivity under UV-visible irradiation as is evident from the photoinduced fusion and fragmentation
                  processes. Binding a photoactive molecule (e.g., pyrene) to metal nanoparticle enhances the photochemical activity and renders
                  the organic-inorganic hybrid nanoassemblies suitable for light-harvesting and optoelectronic applications. The nature of charge-transfer
                  interaction of fluorophore with gold surface dictates the pathways with which the excited-state deactivates. Obtaining insight
                  into energy and electron-transfer processes is important to improve the charge separation efficiencies in metal-fluorophore
                  nanoassemblies and photocatalytic activity of metal-semiconductor composites.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_protein_structure_grd02">The secondary structure of bovine serum albumin (BSA) is determined from infrared spectra (cast films, solution in phosphate
                  buffer) by analyzing the structure of Amide bands. Due to strong overlapping of intrinsic bands three classical methods of
                  band decomposition was implemented: Fourier self deconvolution, second derivatives and band fitting algorithm. The initial
                  values for the number of the components and their position was checked with a novel procedure of dry and hydrated H/D exchange.
                  The most dominant band component in Amide I region is the band at 1654 cm-1, which is usually attributed to a-helical structure.
                  Other bands in Amide I region are attributed to various type of turns. Hydration of protein, as well as the solvation of protein
                  in phosphate buffer, induces the radical change in the secondary structure, especially in the population of a-helices. Drying
                  of the protein film causes a partial denaturation. Classical methods for determine the changes in secondary structure are
                  not accurate enough. Moreover, the interpretation of changes can be easily misleading. Hence, the difference spectroscopy
                  was used to clarify the effects of hydration and solvation on the protein secondary structure. The solvated protein was measured
                  in ATR cell. For proper compare the ATR spectrum with the normal transmission one, first optical constant n and k were calculated
                  and later the exact absorption spectrum.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none"
                  id="abstract_protein_ligand_interactions_fre98">Previous thermodynamic and computational studies have pointed to the important energetic role of aromatic contacts in generating
                  the exceptional binding free energy of streptavidin-biotin association. We report here the crystallographic characterization
                  of single site tryptophan mutants in investigating structural consequences of alterations in these aromatic contacts. Four
                  tryptophan residues, Trp79, Trp92, Trp108 and Trp120, play an important role in the hydrophobic binding contributions, which
                  along with a hydrogen bonding network and a flexible binding loop give rise to tight ligand binding (KaÂ 1013M-1). The crystal
                  structures of ligand-free and biotin-bound mutants, W79F, W108F, W120F and W120A, in the resolution range from 1.9 to 2.3
                  A were determined. Nine data sets for these four different mutants were collected, and structural models were refined to R-values
                  ranging from 0.15 to 0.20. The major question addressed here is how these mutations influence the streptavidin binding site
                  and in particular how they affect the binding mode of biotin in the complex. The overall folding of streptavidin was not significantly
                  altered in any of the tryptophan mutants. With one exception, only minor deviations in the unbound structures were observed.
                  In one crystal form of unbound W79F, there is a coupled shift in the side-chains of Phe29 and Tyr43 toward the mutation site,
                  although in a different crystal form these shifts are not observed. In the bound structures, the orientation of biotin in
                  the binding pocket was not significantly altered in the mutant complex. Compared with the wild-type streptavidin-biotin complex,
                  there were no additional crystallographic water molecules observed for any of the mutants in the binding pocket. These structural
                  studies thus suggest that the thermodynamic alterations can be attributed to the local alterations in binding residue composition,
                  rather than a rearrangement of binding site architectures.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_proteins_che04">For the first time, an aqueous solution of 32-nm gold nanoparticles (GNPs), to which Nile red (NR) has been noncovalently
                  adsorbed, has been used for sensing thiols. The as-prepared NRGNPs fluoresce weakly as a result of fluorescence resonance
                  energy transfer between NR and the GNPs. The fluorescence of a solution containing NRGNPs at pH 4.0 increases upon the addition
                  of thiols, but not when amines, acids, alcohols, bovine serum albumin, or hemoglobin are added. This phenomenon allows for
                  the selective determination of thiols such as cysteamine and homocysteine, which have limits of detection of 10.2 and 10.9
                  nM, respectively, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. Interestingly, we have found that the excitation (ex = 480 nm), emission
                  (em = 610 nm), and mass spectra (m/z 282) of the substance that desorbs from the GNPs in the presence of thiols are different
                  from those of NR (ex = 580 nm; em = 652 nm; m/z 318), which indicates that a new product forms. When simultaneously conducting
                  fluorescence and colorimetric assays, the selectivity of this approach further improves because at pH 4.0, the color of the
                  NRGNPs does not change in the presence of negatively charged thiols, (e.g., N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine), but changes from
                  maroon to purple and lavender in the presence of neutral thiols (e.g., 3-mercapto-1,2-propanediol) and positively charged
                  thiols (e.g., cysteamine), respectively, as a result of aggregation. This feature allows the types of thiols to be determined
                  at concentrations &gt;1.0 and 0.1 ÂµM by the naked eye and by UV-vis absorption, respectively. Depending on the rate at which
                  the NRGNP color changes, reduced glutathione (slow) is readily distinguishable from oxidized glutathione (no aggregation and
                  no displacement) and from cysteine and homocysteine (fast).

                  photons create interband excitons with nonzero electron spin in the first quantum dot. When the quantum-dot pair is properly
                  designed, this excitation can be transferred to the neighboring dot via the Coulomb interaction with conservation or flipping
                  of electron spin. The second dot can radiate circularly polarized photons at smaller energy. Selection rules for spin transfer
                  are determined by the resonant conditions and by the strong spin-orbit interaction in the valence band of nanocrystals. Coulomb-induced
                  energy and spin transfer in pairs and chains of dots can become very efficient under resonant conditions. The electron can
                  preserve its spin orientation even in randomly oriented nanocrystals.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_quantum_theory_and04">We present a model to evaluate the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of electronic excited states of a molecule close to
                  a metal particle of complex shape and, possibly, in the presence of a solvent. The molecule is treated quantum mechanically
                  at Hartree?Fock (HF) or density-functional theory (DFT) level. The metal/solvent is considered as a continuous body, characterized
                  by its frequency dependent local dielectric constant. For simple metal shapes (planar infinite surface and spherical particle)
                  a version of the polarizable continuum model based on the integral equation formalism has been used, while an alternative
                  methodology has been implemented to treat metal particles of arbitrary shape. In both cases, equations have been numerically
                  solved using a boundary element method. Excitation energies and nonradiative decay rates due to the energy transfer from the
                  molecule to the metal are evaluated exploiting the linear response theory (TDHF or TDDFT where TD?time dependent). The radiative
                  decay rate of the whole system (molecule+metal/solvent) is calculated, still using a continuum model, in terms of the response
                  of the surrounding to the molecular transition. The model presented has been applied to the study of the radiative and nonradiative
                  lifetimes of a lissamine molecule in solution (water) and close to gold spherical nanoparticles of different radius. In addition,
                  the influence of the metal shape has been analyzed by performing calculations on a system composed by a coumarin-type molecule
                  close to silver aggregates of complex shape.

                  as well as for the double-stranded DNA molecules. Two states are fluorescent, with lifetimes in the range of 0.5-1 ns and

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_radiation_quenching_ang06">We present an experimental and theoretical study of the fluorescence rate of a single molecule as a function of its distance
                  to a laser-irradiated gold nanoparticle. The local field enhancement leads to an increased excitation rate whereas nonradiative
                  energy transfer to the particle leads to a decrease of the quantum yield (quenching). Because of these competing effects,
                  previous experiments showed either fluorescence enhancement or fluorescence quenching. By varying the distance between molecule
                  and particle we show the first experimental measurement demonstrating the continuous transition from fluorescence enhancement
                  to fluorescence quenching. This transition cannot be explained by treating the particle as a polarizable sphere in the dipole
                  approximation.

                  DNA is used as a rigid spacer to tune the distance between the two nanoparticles. The width of the fluorescent intensity distribution,
                  monitored at different interparticle distances, reflects both the nanoparticle heterogeneity and the fluorescence intermittency
                  of the quantum dot. The fluorescence distribution emitted by single CdSe nanocrystals can easily be distinguished from the
                  fluorescence of partially quenched CdSe. Our results show that the distance-dependence quenching is compatible with a FÃ¶rster-type

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_radiationless_decay_liv85">In this work we shall develop a formalism which extends previous calculations of lifetimes of excited molecular states near
                  planar dielectric surfaces and near single small dielectric particles to situations where the molecule is adsorbed on a cluster
                  made of several dielectric spherical grains. The nonradiative relaxation rate is seen to be relatively weakly dependent on
                  the cluster structure and, if the molecule is adsorbed on one of the grains, is well approximated by the single grain result.
                  The radiative decay rate and hence the quantum yield are much more sensitive to the geometry of the cluster which determines
                  the position (in frequency) of the dielectric resonances of the cluster. The formalism developed here may be used to evaluate
                  local field intensities at different positions within a cluster of dielectric grains under the influence of an external incident

                  id="abstract_radiative_decay_engineering_ged03a">Substantial increases in fluorescence emission from fluorophore-protein-coated fractal-like silver structures have been observed.
                  We review two methods for silver fractal structure preparation, which have been employed and studied. The first, a roughened
                  silver electrode, typically yielded a 100-fold increase in fluorophore emission, and the second, silver fractal-like structures
                  grown on glass between two silver electrodes, produced a [ap]500-fold increase. In addition, significant increases in probe
                  photostability were observed for probes coated on the silver fractal like structures. These results further serve to compliment
                  our recent work on the effects of nobel metal particles with fluorophores, a relatively new phenomenon in fluorescence we
                  have termed both 'metal-enhanced fluorescence' [1] and 'radiative decay engineering' [2,3]. These results are explained by
                  the metallic surfaces modifying the radiative decay rate ([Gamma]) of the fluorescent labels. We believe that this new silver-surface
                  preparation, which results in ultrabright and photostable fluorophores, offers a new generic technology platform for increased
                  fluorescence signal levels, with widespread potential applications to the analytical sciences, imaging, and medical diagnostics.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_radiative_lifetimes_and04">We present a model to evaluate the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of electronic excited states of a molecule close to
                  a metal particle of complex shape and, possibly, in the presence of a solvent. The molecule is treated quantum mechanically
                  at Hartree?Fock (HF) or density-functional theory (DFT) level. The metal/solvent is considered as a continuous body, characterized
                  by its frequency dependent local dielectric constant. For simple metal shapes (planar infinite surface and spherical particle)
                  a version of the polarizable continuum model based on the integral equation formalism has been used, while an alternative
                  methodology has been implemented to treat metal particles of arbitrary shape. In both cases, equations have been numerically
                  solved using a boundary element method. Excitation energies and nonradiative decay rates due to the energy transfer from the
                  molecule to the metal are evaluated exploiting the linear response theory (TDHF or TDDFT where TD?time dependent). The radiative
                  decay rate of the whole system (molecule+metal/solvent) is calculated, still using a continuum model, in terms of the response
                  of the surrounding to the molecular transition. The model presented has been applied to the study of the radiative and nonradiative
                  lifetimes of a lissamine molecule in solution (water) and close to gold spherical nanoparticles of different radius. In addition,
                  the influence of the metal shape has been analyzed by performing calculations on a system composed by a coumarin-type molecule
                  close to silver aggregates of complex shape.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_radiative_lifetimes_cor03">We present a model for the evaluation of the metal-induced deexcitation rate for molecules close to a metal surface. In this
                  model, the molecule is treated quantum mechanically at the density-functional theory level and its excitations with a time-dependent
                  density-functional theory procedure. The metal is described through its dielectric response properties. The nonlocal features
                  of such a response are taken into account by using a modified Lindhard-Mermin dielectric constant. The presence of small random
                  roughness on the metal surface is described with the model of Rahman and Maradudin [Phys. Rev. B 21, 504 (1980)]. Systems
                  in which the molecule close to the metal is immersed in an homogeneous matrix or deposited on a spacer are considered. The
                  matrix and the spacer are treated with the polarizable continuum model. The molecule-metal and the molecule-matrix (or molecule-spacer)
                  electrostatic interactions are described by using the integral equation formalism, numerically treated with a boundary element
                  method. As a test case, the method has been applied to the study of phosphorescence from biacetyl close to a silver surface
                  and immersed in or deposited on solid ammonia. Our results show that nonlocal metal response and surface roughness have an
                  important role in explaining measured lifetimes.

                  are investigated by means of time-resolved fluorescence experiments. A pronounced fluorescence quenching is observed already
                  for the smallest nanoparticles of 1 nm radius. The quenching is caused not only by an increased nonradiative rate but, equally
                  important, by a drastic decrease in the dye's radiative rate. Assuming resonant energy transfer to be responsible for the
                  nonradiative decay channel, we compare our experimental findings with theoretical results derived from the Gersten-Nitzan
                  model.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_radiative_lifetimes_hud03">A near-field optical imaging approach is demonstrated for simultaneous topographic and spectroscopic imaging with spatial
                  resolution beyond the optical diffraction limit. The method combines metallic-tip-based tapping-mode atomic force microscopy
                  (AFM) with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The AFM metallic tip was formed by sputter coating a Si tapping
                  mode tip with Au, in a way that forms a globular tip apex. Such tip apex generates high local electric field enhancement under
                  laser illumination, which provides a strong electric-field interaction between the AFM tip and the fluorescent molecules under
                  the tip. The tip perturbation of fluorescence gives the fluorescence lifetime changes that provide the AFM-FLIM imaging contrast.
                  A finite element method simulation was used to further evaluate the electric near-field enhancement and electric field distribution
                  originating from the metallic Au-coated AFM tapping-mode tip. We have demonstrated that spatially mapping the change in fluorescence
                  lifetime and intensity is a promising approach to spectroscopic imaging at an AFM spatial resolution typically defined by
                  the apex diameter of the AFM tips. The globular Au-coated AFM tip not only gives adequate spatial AFM tapping-mode imaging
                  spatial resolution but also is "environmentally friendly" to soft samples, such as polymeric dye-labeled nanospheres and even
                  biological specimens such as POPO-3 labeled DNA.

                  lifetime and the fluorescence rate of single molecules are recorded simultaneously as a function of the tip position relative

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_raman_spectra_wei83">The enhancements of normal Raman scattering, resonance Raman scattering, and fluorescence from molecules adsorbed on identical,
                  well-characterized, silver-island films are reported. The enhancement arises from the electromagnetic interaction between
                  the molecules and the electronic plasma resonance of the silver islands. A hierarchy of enhancement ratios is found, with
                  typical values of 105 for RS, 103 for RRS and 10?1 to 10 for fluorescence, depending on the quantum yield of the molecular
                  fluorescence. A model, developed on heuristic grounds and substantiated using the density matrix formalism, describes the
                  light scattering processes and the effects of the plasma resonance. This model presents a unified picture of the surface-induced
                  enhancement effects and is consistent with the experimental values. The comparison of all the forms of optical scattering
                  leads to a complete determination of the role of the plasma resonances in the various portions of the scattering process.
                  The excitation of the electronic plasma resonance results in an increased local field at the molecules leading to an increased
                  excitation or absorption rate. Similarly, the excitation of the plasma resonance by the molecular emission dipole results
                  in an increase in the radiative decay rate. However, the electromagnetic coupling of the molecule to the plasma resonance
                  also adds an additional damping channel which can result in a reduction of the absorption or excitation rate as well as the
                  emission yield. The resultant balance of these processes leads to the hierarchy in the measured enhancements. The hierarchy
                  of enhancements is also shown to have important spectroscopic consequences.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_raman_scattering_ben05">Membrane topology of receptors plays an important role in shaping transmembrane signalling of cells. Among the methods used
                  for characterizing receptor clusters, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a donor and acceptor fluorophore plays
                  a unique role based on its capability of detecting molecular level (2-10 nm) proximities of receptors in physiological conditions.
                  Recent development of biotechnology has made possible the usage of colloidal gold particles in a large size range for specific
                  labelling of cells for the purposes of electron microscopy. However, by combining metal and fluorophore labelling or cells,
                  the versatility of metal-fluorophore interactions opens the way for new applications by detecting the presence of the metal
                  particles by the methods of fluorescence spectroscopy. An outstanding feature of the metal nanoparticle-fluorophore interaction
                  is that the metal particle can enhance spontaneous emission of the fluorophore in a distance-dependent fashion, in an interaction
                  range esentially determined by the size of the nanoparticle. In our work enhanced fluorescence of rhodamine and cyanine dyes
                  was observed in the vicinity of immunogold nanoparticles on the surface of JY cells in a flow cytometer. The dyes and the
                  immunogold were targetted to the cell surface receptors MHCI, MHCII, transferrin receptor and CD45 by monoclonal antibodies.
                  The fluorescence enhancement was sensitive to the wavelength of the exciting light, the size and amount of surface bound gold
                  beads, as well as the fluorophore-nanoparticle distance. The intensity of 90&amp;DEG; scattering of the incident light beam was
                  enhanced by the immunogold in a concentration and size-dependent fashion. The 90&amp;DEG; light scattering varied with the wavelength
                  of the incident light in a manner characteristic to gold nanoparticles of the applied sizes. A reduction in photobleaching
                  time constant of the cyanine dye was observed in the vicinity of gold particles in a digital imaging microscope. Modulations
                  of 90&amp;DEG; light scattering intensity and photobleaching time constant indicate the role of the local field in the fluorescence
                  enhancement. A mathematical simulation based on the electrodynamic theory of fluorescence enhancement showed a consistency
                  between the measured enhancement values, the inter-epitope distances and the quantum yields. The feasibility of realizing
                  proximity sensors operating at distance ranges larger than that of the conventional Forster transfer is demonstrated on the
                  surface of living cells. Copyright &amp;COPY; 2004 John Wiley&amp; Sons, Ltd.

                  nanoparticles in N,N-dimethylformamide. The formation of particle aggregates was observed upon mixing the particle solution
                  with the complex solution, in which the complexes behaved like linker molecules. Luminescent intensity of the complexes was
                  enhanced in the presence of silver nanoparticles, but at only a limited particle concentration region. The observed particle
                  concentration dependences of the luminescent intensity were regarded as the result of a delicate balance between an enhancing
                  and a quenching effect of the silver nanoparticles. In addition to the change in intensity, silver nanoparticles also affected
                  the asymmetric ratio (or monochromaticity) of the europium luminescence. These changes in the luminescent properties of the
                  complex were discussed in terms of the effects of particle aggregates and consequent modifications of the local electromagnetic

                  by using different mole ratios of silver nitrate/tiopronin. Ligands on the silver particles were partially displaced by fluorescein-labeled
                  thiolate single-stranded oligonucleotides or their complementary unlabeled oligonucleotides through ligand exchange. The fluorophores
                  on silver particles showed a surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF) dependent on the size of metallic cores. The particles could
                  be coupled through hybridizations of oligonucleotides bound on the particles. The coupled particles were aggregated due to
                  multiple displacements of oligonucleotides on each particle, resulting in stronger SEF. The dye-labeled oligonucleotides were
                  assembled on the silver islands on the solid substrate, and the complementary oligonucleotide-displaced particles were coupled
                  via oligonucleotide hybridization. The couplings between particles and islands resulted in an obvious fluorescence enhancement.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_raman_scattering_sers_luy05">We present novel gold nanophotonic crescent moon structures with a sub-10 nm sharp edge, which can enhance local electromagnetic
                  field at the edge area. The formation of unconventional nanophotonic crescent moon structure is accomplished by using a sacrificial
                  nanosphere template and conventional thin film deposition method, which allows an effective batch nanofabrication and precise
                  controls of nanostructure shapes. Unique multiple scattering peaks are observed in a single gold nanocrescent moon with dark-field
                  white light illumination. A 785 nm near-infrared (NIR) diode laser was used as the excitation source to induce the amplified
                  scattering field on the sharp edge of the single gold nanocrescent moon. The Raman scattering spectrum of Rhodamine 6G molecules
                  adsorbed on the single gold nanocrescent moon are characterized, and the Raman enhancement factor of single gold nanocrescent
                  moon is estimated larger than 10(10), which suggests the potential applications of gold nanocrescent moons in ultrasensitive
                  biomolecular detection and cellular imaging using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy.

                  id="abstract_random_sequential_adsorption_asl04a">Biotinylated gold nanoparticles were prepared by using a two-step surface modification procedure. First, a carboxyl-terminated
                  alkanethiol was chemisorbed onto the surface of gold nanoparticles in the presence of a stabilizing agent. Subsequently, the
                  carboxyl groups were reacted with (+)-biotinyl-3,6,9,-trioxaundecanediamine and 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol. This procedure resulted
                  in stable, ligand-modified gold nanoparticles. Upon interaction with streptavidin, the biotinylated gold nanoparticles aggregated
                  by means of specific biomolecular recognition. Their aggregation was studied by optical absorption spectroscopy. Controlled
                  aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles resulted in a shift in the surface plasmon resonance peak and broadening of
                  the absorption spectrum of the nanoparticles. The spectral changes were used to assess the extent of aggregation. Aggregation
                  was found to be dependent on the concentrations of streptavidin, biotinylated gold nanoparticles, and the surface mole fraction
                  of biotin groups on the nanoparticles. Maximum aggregation was observed when 24 nM streptavidin and 0.80 nM biotinylated gold
                  nanoparticles were used. Reversal of nanoparticle aggregation was accomplished by the addition of soluble biotin to the streptavidin-nanoparticle
                  aggregates. Kinetic analysis of the absorbance data showed that streptavidin-induced aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles
                  could be interpreted in terms of a Reaction-Limited Colloidal Aggregation (RLCA) model. This indicates that optical absorption
                  spectroscopy can provide a quantitative measurement of the aggregation process.

                  that the assembly of gold nanoparticles can be controlled by the gradient force. This is attributed to the soft confinement

                  and rate equation formalisms, we show that, for surface coverages at which the surface immobilized molecules interact, barriers
                  to penetration create a distribution of target molecule concentrations within the adsorbed layer. By approximately enumerating
                  probe and target conformations, we estimate the probability of overlap between complementary probe and target regions as a
                  function of probe density and chain length. In agreement with experiments, we find that as probe molecules interact more strongly,
                  fewer nucleation sites become accessible and binding rates are diminished relative to those in solution. Nucleation sites
                  near the grafted end of the probes are least accessible; thus targets which preferentially bind to this region show more drastic
                  rate reductions than those that bind near the free end of the probe. The implications of these results for DNA-based biosensors
                  are discussed.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_real_time_sey05">Efforts to improve the performance of immunoassays and immunosensors by incorporating different kinds of nanostructures have
                  gained considerable momentum over the last decade. Apart from liposomes, which will not be discussed here, most groups focus
                  on artificial, particulate marker systems, both organic and inorganic. The underlying detection procedures may be based either
                  on electro-magnetical or optical techniques. This review will be confined to the latter only, comprising nanoparticle applications
                  generating signals as diverse as static and time-resolved luminescence, one- and two-photon absorption, Raman and Rayleigh
                  scattering as well as surface plasmon resonance and others. In general, all endeavors cited are geared to achieve one or more
                  of the following goals: lowering of detection limits (if possible, down to single-molecule level), parallel integration of
                  multiple signals (multiplexing), signal amplification by several orders of magnitude and prevention of photobleaching effects
                  with concomitant maintenance of antigen binding specificity and sensitivity. Inorganic nanoparticle labels based on noble
                  metals, semiconductor quantum dots and nanoshells appear to be the most versatile systems for these bioanalytical applications

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_recognition_che04">For the first time, an aqueous solution of 32-nm gold nanoparticles (GNPs), to which Nile red (NR) has been noncovalently
                  adsorbed, has been used for sensing thiols. The as-prepared NRGNPs fluoresce weakly as a result of fluorescence resonance
                  energy transfer between NR and the GNPs. The fluorescence of a solution containing NRGNPs at pH 4.0 increases upon the addition
                  of thiols, but not when amines, acids, alcohols, bovine serum albumin, or hemoglobin are added. This phenomenon allows for
                  the selective determination of thiols such as cysteamine and homocysteine, which have limits of detection of 10.2 and 10.9
                  nM, respectively, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. Interestingly, we have found that the excitation (ex = 480 nm), emission
                  (em = 610 nm), and mass spectra (m/z 282) of the substance that desorbs from the GNPs in the presence of thiols are different
                  from those of NR (ex = 580 nm; em = 652 nm; m/z 318), which indicates that a new product forms. When simultaneously conducting
                  fluorescence and colorimetric assays, the selectivity of this approach further improves because at pH 4.0, the color of the
                  NRGNPs does not change in the presence of negatively charged thiols, (e.g., N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine), but changes from
                  maroon to purple and lavender in the presence of neutral thiols (e.g., 3-mercapto-1,2-propanediol) and positively charged
                  thiols (e.g., cysteamine), respectively, as a result of aggregation. This feature allows the types of thiols to be determined
                  at concentrations &gt;1.0 and 0.1 ÂµM by the naked eye and by UV-vis absorption, respectively. Depending on the rate at which
                  the NRGNP color changes, reduced glutathione (slow) is readily distinguishable from oxidized glutathione (no aggregation and
                  no displacement) and from cysteine and homocysteine (fast).

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_recognition_ohe05">An inhibition assay method was developed based on the modulation in the FRET efficiency between quantum dots (QDs) and gold
                  nanoparticles (AuNPs) in the presence of the molecules which inhibit the interactions between QD- and AuNP-conjugated biomolecules.
                  For the functionalization, AuNPs were first stabilized by chemisorption of n-alkanethiols and then capped with the first generation
                  polyamidoamine (G1 PAMAM) dendrimers. By employing a streptavidin-biotin couple as a model system, avidin was quantitatively
                  analyzed as an inhibitor by sensing the change in photoluminescence (PL) quenching of SA-QDs by biotin-AuNPs. The detection
                  limit for avidin was about 10 nM. It is anticipated that the PL quenching-based sensing system can be used for the quantitative
                  analysis and high throughput screening of molecules which inhibit the specific biomolecular interactions.

                  properties of individual metallic particles. {W}e start by giving a historical overview and a conceptual discussion on the
                  subject of small particles, underlining their potential applications. {S}implified optical response functions for a metallic

                  resonance effects and far-infrared properties exhibited by simple and noble metal particles having less than 100 {\AA} radii.
                  {A} comparison between the traditional ({M}ie) approach and the proposed non-local scheme is made and it leads to an increased

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_reflectivity_soe00">We have developed a simple, fast, and flexible technique to measure optical scattering spectra of individual metallic nanoparticles.
                  The particles are placed in an evanescent field produced by total internal reflection of light from a halogen lamp in a glass
                  prism. The light scattered by individual particles is collected using a conventional microscope and is spectrally analyzed
                  by a nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled-device array coupled to a spectrometer. This technique is employed to measure the effect
                  of particle diameter on the dephasing time of the particle plasmon resonance in gold nanoparticles. We also demonstrate the
                  use of this technique for measurements in liquids, which is important for the potential application of particle plasmons in
                  chemical or biological nanosensors.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_relaxation_liv85">In this work we shall develop a formalism which extends previous calculations of lifetimes of excited molecular states near
                  planar dielectric surfaces and near single small dielectric particles to situations where the molecule is adsorbed on a cluster
                  made of several dielectric spherical grains. The nonradiative relaxation rate is seen to be relatively weakly dependent on
                  the cluster structure and, if the molecule is adsorbed on one of the grains, is well approximated by the single grain result.
                  The radiative decay rate and hence the quantum yield are much more sensitive to the geometry of the cluster which determines
                  the position (in frequency) of the dielectric resonances of the cluster. The formalism developed here may be used to evaluate
                  local field intensities at different positions within a cluster of dielectric grains under the influence of an external incident
                  field. The Journal of Chemical Physics is copyrighted by The American Institute of Physics.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_resonance_bou05">Single two-dimensional planar silver arrays and one-dimensional linear gold chains of nanoparticles were investigated by dark-field
                  surface plasmon spectroscopy and studied as a function of interparticle distance, particle size, and number of particles.
                  In agreement with recent theoretical predictions, a red shift of the surface plasmon resonance occurring in two-dimensional
                  arrays was found for lattice spacings below 200 nm. This red shift is associated with a significant broadening of the resonance
                  and is attributed to the onset of near-field interactions. We found that the relative contributions of the long-range and
                  short-range interactions in two-dimensional arrays of particles are fundamentally different to those occurring in individual
                  linear chains.an

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_resonance_sto02">The binding affinity of deoxynucleosides (dA, dG, dC, and dT) to gold nanoparticles was studied using a colorimetric assay
                  to determine if nucleobase sequence may play a role in binding alkanethiol-capped oligonucleotides to gold nanoparticles.
                  These data indicate that the deoxynucleoside dT has a much lower binding affinity to the gold nanoparticle surface than the
                  deoxynucleosides dG, dC, and dA. These data can be correlated with a previous study in our lab which indicated that alkanethiol-capped
                  oligonucleotides containing (dT)20 spacers have a significantly higher surface coverage than oligonucleotides containing (dA)20
                  spacers. To probe the physical consequences of this phenomenon, gold nanoparticles were loaded with alkanethiol-capped poly
                  dT, dA, and dC oligonucleotide sequences of 5-20 bases in length, and the stabilities of the particles in electrolytic media
                  were measured by monitoring a colorimetric change associated with particle agglomeration. The gold nanoparticles loaded with
                  alkanethiol-capped poly dT oligonucleotides exhibited a dramatic increase in stability as the oligonucleotide length was increased
                  from 5 to 20 bases. By comparison, gold nanoparticles loaded with poly dC and poly dA sequences exhibited only a slight increase
                  in stability as the oligonucleotide length was increased. The sequence-dependent stability observed for the DNA-modified gold
                  nanoparticles is attributed to the weaker interaction of the deoxynucleoside dT with the gold nanoparticle surface which results
                  in higher surface coverages and consequently enhanced stability as the oligonucleotide length is increased.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_resonance_xux4">It is well known that surface plasmon absorption (color) of Au nanoparticles highly depends on its size, shape, and surrounding
                  surface environment, providing a great opportunity for the development of Au nanoparticles as a probe for chemical and biochemical
                  sensing and as a building block for nano-optical devices. Currently, it remains incompletely understood how the surface properties
                  of Au nanoparticles ultimately define its optical properties, hindering the progress of rational design of Au nanoparticles
                  for biochemical sensing and assembly of nano-optical devices. Ru(bpy)32+ possesses rich photochemical and electrochemical
                  properties, offering a unique probe to study the surface environment of Au nanoparticles. In this study, we investigate the
                  kinetics of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles (6.5, 19, 48, 97 nm) in the presence of Ru(bpy)32+ at 24.0, 33.0,
                  and 51.0 C. We find that the color-change rate of Au nanoparticles is highly sensitive to the amount of Ru(bpy)32+. In addition,
                  the minimum (critical) concentration of Ru(bpy)32+ needed to change the color of Au nanoparticles is highly dependent upon
                  temperature and nanoparticle size. TEM images illustrate that the color-change mechanism of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+
                  highly depends on the size of nanoparticles. Control experiments using NaCl and MgCl2 to replace Ru(bpy)32+ show no color
                  change, suggesting that the color change of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+ is not solely attributable to the salt
                  effect. Other factors, such as adsorption of Ru(bpy)32+ on the Au nanoparticle surface, may be involved. Moreover, in the
                  presence of the critical concentration of Ru(bpy)32+, as temperature increases from 24.0 C to 51.0 C, the color-change rate
                  of 19 nm Au nanoparticles increases 8-fold, whereas the color-change rate of 48 nm Au nanoparticles decreases 3-fold, showing
                  the temperature dependence of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles in the presence of surface adsorbates, Ru(bpy)32+.

                  thiolate single-stranded oligonucleotides or their complementary unlabeled oligonucleotides through ligand exchange. The fluorophores
                  on silver particles showed a surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF) dependent on the size of metallic cores. The particles could
                  be coupled through hybridizations of oligonucleotides bound on the particles. The coupled particles were aggregated due to
                  multiple displacements of oligonucleotides on each particle, resulting in stronger SEF. The dye-labeled oligonucleotides were
                  assembled on the silver islands on the solid substrate, and the complementary oligonucleotide-displaced particles were coupled
                  via oligonucleotide hybridization. The couplings between particles and islands resulted in an obvious fluorescence enhancement.

                  id="abstract_resonance_energy_transfer_hei05">We demonstrate that commercially available unmodified carbocyanine dyes such as Cy5 (usually excited at 633 nm) can be used
                  as efficient reversible single-molecule optical switch, whose fluorescent state after apparent photobleaching can be restored
                  at room temperature upon irradiation at shorter wavelengths. Ensemble photobleaching and recovery experiments of Cy5 in aqueous
                  solution irradiating first at 633 nm, then at 337, 488, or 532 nm, demonstrate that restoration of absorption and fluorescence
                  strongly depends on efficient oxygen removal and the addition of the triplet quencher -mercaptoethylamine. Single-molecule
                  fluorescence experiments show that individual immobilized Cy5 molecules can be switched optically in milliseconds by applying
                  alternating excitation at 633 and 488 nm between a fluorescent and nonfluorescent state up to 100 times with a reliability
                  of &gt;90% at room temperature. Because of their intriguing performance, carbocyanine dyes volunteer as a simple alternative
                  for ultrahigh-density optical data storage. Measurements on single donor/acceptor (tetramethylrhodamine/Cy5) labeled oligonucleotides
                  point out that the described light-driven switching behavior imposes fundamental limitations on the use of carbocyanine dyes
                  as energy transfer acceptors for the study of biological processes.

                  id="abstract_resonance_energy_transfer_mar03">Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements were performed to elucidate the fluorescence quenching of oxazine,
                  rhodamine, carbocyanine, and bora-diaza-indacene dyes by amino acids. Among the natural amino acids, tryptophan exhibits the
                  most pronounced quenching efficiency. Especially, the red-absorbing dyes ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine derivative MR
                  121 are strongly quenched almost exclusively by tryptophan due to the formation of weak or nonfluorescent ground-state complexes
                  with association constants, Kass., ranging from 96 to 206 M-1. Rhodamine, fluorescein, and bora-diaza-indacene derivatives
                  that absorb at shorter wavelengths are also quenched substantially by tyrosine residues. The quenching of carbocyanine dyes,
                  such as Cy5, and Alexa 647 by amino acids can be almost neglected. While quenching of ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine
                  derivative MR121 by tryptophan is dominated by static quenching, dynamic quenching is more efficient for the two bora-diaza-indacene
                  dyes Bodipy-FL and Bodipy630/650. Labeling of the dyes to tryptophan, tryptophan-containing peptides, and proteins (streptavidin)
                  demonstrates that knowledge of these fluorescence quenching processes is crucial for the development of fluorescence-based
                  diagnostic assays. Changes in the fluorescence quantum yield of dye-labeled peptides and proteins might be used advantageously
                  for the quantification of proteases and specific binding partners.

                  nanoparticles in N,N-dimethylformamide. The formation of particle aggregates was observed upon mixing the particle solution
                  with the complex solution, in which the complexes behaved like linker molecules. Luminescent intensity of the complexes was
                  enhanced in the presence of silver nanoparticles, but at only a limited particle concentration region. The observed particle
                  concentration dependences of the luminescent intensity were regarded as the result of a delicate balance between an enhancing
                  and a quenching effect of the silver nanoparticles. In addition to the change in intensity, silver nanoparticles also affected
                  the asymmetric ratio (or monochromaticity) of the europium luminescence. These changes in the luminescent properties of the
                  complex were discussed in terms of the effects of particle aggregates and consequent modifications of the local electromagnetic
                  field, refractive index, and the ligand field around europium ion.

                  at the 5' ends with 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TMRh). The temperature and ionic strength of the solutions were varied
                  over large ranges. The results reveal at least three well-defined states of the TMRh-DNA molecules for the single-stranded
                  as well as for the double-stranded DNA molecules. Two states are fluorescent, with lifetimes in the range of 0.5-1 ns and
                  2.5-3 ns. A third state of TMRh-DNA does not fluoresce (a dark species of TMRh-DNA). The distribution of the TMRh-DNA molecules
                  among these three slates is strongly temperature and ionic strength dependent. Estimates are made of some reaction parameters
                  of the multistate model. The results are discussed in terms of the photophysics of TMRh, and consequences of the multiple
                  conformers of TMRh-DNA for studies involving fluorescence studies with TMRh-labeled DNA are considered.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_resonance_raman_gra95">The design and initial characterization of two-dimensional arrays of colloidal Au particles are reported. These surfaces are
                  prepared by self-assembly of 12 nn diameter colloidal Au particles onto immobilized polymers having pendant functional groups
                  with high affinity for Au (i.e., CN, SH, and NH2). The polymers are formed by condensation of functionalized alkoxysilanes
                  onto cleaned quartz, glass, and SiO2 surfaces. The assembly protocol is carried out completely in solution: cleaned substrates
                  are immersed in methanolic solutions of organosilane, rinsed, and subsequently immersed in aqueous colloidal Au solutions.
                  Two-dimensional arrays spontaneously form on the polymer surface, The resulting substrates have been characterized by UV-vis
                  spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). TEM data show that the
                  particles are spatially separated but close enough to interact electromagnetically (small spacing compared to lambda). The
                  UV-vis data show that collective particle surface plasmon modes are present in the 650-750 nm region, suggesting that these
                  assemblies are SERS-active. This is indeed the case, with enhancement factors of roughly 10(4). Au colloid monolayers possess
                  a set of features that make them very attractive for both basic and applied uses, including uniform roughness, high stability,
                  and biocompatibility.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_resonance_raman_joh05">We present a general model study of surface-enhanced resonant Raman scattering and fluorescence, focusing on the interplay
                  between electromagnetic (EM) effects and the molecular dynamics as treated by a density matrix calculation. The model molecule
                  has two electronic levels, is affected by radiative and nonradiative damping mechanisms, and a Franck-Condon mechanism yields
                  electron-vibration coupling. The coupling between the molecule and the electromagnetic field is enhanced by placing it between
                  two Ag nanoparticles. The results show that the Raman scattering cross section can, for realistic parameter values, increase
                  by some 10 orders of magnitude (to similar to 10(-14) cm(2)) compared with the free-space case. Also the fluorescence cross
                  section grows with increasing EM enhancement, however, at a slower rate, and this increase eventually stalls when nonradiative
                  decay processes become important. Finally, we find that anti-Stokes Raman scattering is possible with strong incident laser
                  intensities similar to 1 mW/mu m(2).

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_resonance_scattering_wei83">The enhancements of normal Raman scattering, resonance Raman scattering, and fluorescence from molecules adsorbed on identical,
                  well-characterized, silver-island films are reported. The enhancement arises from the electromagnetic interaction between
                  the molecules and the electronic plasma resonance of the silver islands. A hierarchy of enhancement ratios is found, with
                  typical values of 105 for RS, 103 for RRS and 10?1 to 10 for fluorescence, depending on the quantum yield of the molecular
                  fluorescence. A model, developed on heuristic grounds and substantiated using the density matrix formalism, describes the
                  light scattering processes and the effects of the plasma resonance. This model presents a unified picture of the surface-induced
                  enhancement effects and is consistent with the experimental values. The comparison of all the forms of optical scattering
                  leads to a complete determination of the role of the plasma resonances in the various portions of the scattering process.
                  The excitation of the electronic plasma resonance results in an increased local field at the molecules leading to an increased
                  excitation or absorption rate. Similarly, the excitation of the plasma resonance by the molecular emission dipole results
                  in an increase in the radiative decay rate. However, the electromagnetic coupling of the molecule to the plasma resonance
                  also adds an additional damping channel which can result in a reduction of the absorption or excitation rate as well as the
                  emission yield. The resultant balance of these processes leads to the hierarchy in the measured enhancements. The hierarchy
                  of enhancements is also shown to have important spectroscopic consequences.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_rhodamine_dyes_nor97">The increased sensitivity and the advantage of new lopw-cost optical sources and detectros in the red region creates a great
                  demand for new efficient fluorescence labels in this wavelength region. Here some problems arise due to the fact that with
                  increasing absorption wavelength the fluorescence quantum yield drastically decreases, especially in aqueous media. Additionally,
                  organic dyes may aggregate and show non-specific agginities to biological materials. We investigate the interactions of recently
                  developed fluorescent dyes and two commercially available fluorescent dyes with the DNA base guanosine. The results obtained
                  in intermolecular quenching experiments reveal various fluorescence quenching effects. Due to the increasing hydrophobicity
                  of fluorescent dyes with increasing molecular size the aggregation tendency with biological materials also increases. Therefore
                  ground and excited state interactions increase thus promoting the observed fluorescence quenching.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_rhodamine_dyes_sau95">The increased sensitivity together with the advent of low-cost optical sources and detectors in the visible-near IR region
                  has led us to current efforts to develop new efficient fluorescent labels for biodiagnostics with absorption and emission
                  beyond 600 nm. In view of the general fluorescence decrease with increasing emission wavelength, we investigated the possibility
                  to shift the absorption of rhodamine dyes toward the region 620-670 nm. The hydrophobic nature of all known long-wavelength
                  dyes results in the tendency to form intra- and intermolecular aggregates in hydrophilic solvents, especially in aqueous environment.
                  Due to the aggregation with biological materials, fluorescence quenching of the dyes is often observed. New strategies for
                  prevention of these processes are considered.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_rna_son05">Forster Resonance Energy Transfer has served as a molecular ruler that reports conformational changes and intramolecular distances
                  of single biomolecules(1-4). However, such rulers suffer from low and fluctuating signal intensities, limited observation
                  time due to photobleaching, and an upper distance limit of similar to 10 nm. Noble metal nanoparticles have plasmon resonances
                  in the visible range and do not blink or bleach. They have been employed as alternative probes to overcome the limitations
                  of organic fluorophores(5,6), and the coupling of plasmons in nearby particles has been exploited to detect particle aggregation
                  by a distinct color change in bulk experiments(7-9). Here we demonstrate that plasmon coupling can be used to monitor distances
                  between single pairs of gold and silver nanoparticles. We followed the directed assembly of gold and silver nanoparticle dimers
                  in real time and studied the kinetics of single DNA hybridization events. These 'plasmon rulers' allowed us to continuously
                  monitor separations of up to 70 nm for &gt;3,000 s.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_rough_surfaces_ben05">Membrane topology of receptors plays an important role in shaping transmembrane signalling of cells. Among the methods used
                  for characterizing receptor clusters, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a donor and acceptor fluorophore plays
                  a unique role based on its capability of detecting molecular level (2-10 nm) proximities of receptors in physiological conditions.
                  Recent development of biotechnology has made possible the usage of colloidal gold particles in a large size range for specific
                  labelling of cells for the purposes of electron microscopy. However, by combining metal and fluorophore labelling or cells,
                  the versatility of metal-fluorophore interactions opens the way for new applications by detecting the presence of the metal
                  particles by the methods of fluorescence spectroscopy. An outstanding feature of the metal nanoparticle-fluorophore interaction
                  is that the metal particle can enhance spontaneous emission of the fluorophore in a distance-dependent fashion, in an interaction
                  range esentially determined by the size of the nanoparticle. In our work enhanced fluorescence of rhodamine and cyanine dyes
                  was observed in the vicinity of immunogold nanoparticles on the surface of JY cells in a flow cytometer. The dyes and the
                  immunogold were targetted to the cell surface receptors MHCI, MHCII, transferrin receptor and CD45 by monoclonal antibodies.
                  The fluorescence enhancement was sensitive to the wavelength of the exciting light, the size and amount of surface bound gold
                  beads, as well as the fluorophore-nanoparticle distance. The intensity of 90&amp;DEG; scattering of the incident light beam was
                  enhanced by the immunogold in a concentration and size-dependent fashion. The 90&amp;DEG; light scattering varied with the wavelength
                  of the incident light in a manner characteristic to gold nanoparticles of the applied sizes. A reduction in photobleaching
                  time constant of the cyanine dye was observed in the vicinity of gold particles in a digital imaging microscope. Modulations
                  of 90&amp;DEG; light scattering intensity and photobleaching time constant indicate the role of the local field in the fluorescence
                  enhancement. A mathematical simulation based on the electrodynamic theory of fluorescence enhancement showed a consistency
                  between the measured enhancement values, the inter-epitope distances and the quantum yields. The feasibility of realizing
                  proximity sensors operating at distance ranges larger than that of the conventional Forster transfer is demonstrated on the
                  surface of living cells. Copyright &amp;COPY; 2004 John Wiley&amp; Sons, Ltd.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_rough_surfaces_kel03">The optical properties of metal nanoparticles have long been of interest in physical chemistry, starting with Faraday's investigations
                  of colloidal gold in the middle 1800s. More recently, new lithographic techniques as well as improvements to classical wet
                  chemistry methods have made it possible to synthesize noble metal nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes, shapes, and dielectric
                  environments. In this feature article, we describe recent progress in the theory of nanoparticle optical properties, particularly
                  methods for solving Maxwell's equations for light scattering from particles of arbitrary shape in a complex environment. Included
                  is a description of the qualitative features of dipole and quadrupole plasmon resonances for spherical particles; a discussion
                  of analytical and numerical methods for calculating extinction and scattering cross-sections, local fields, and other optical

                  of the diffraction theory for a dipole antenna established by Van del Pol and Bremmer. This theory is somewhat simpler than
                  but formally equivalent to that established by Ruppin and preserves a feature which is closer to the method of the theory
                  established by Chance, Prock, and Silbey for a flat surface. The results, when compared to those obtained from the static
                  image theory, show that this latter theory can be very inaccurate for large molecule-sphere distances or highly conducting
                  spheres, consistent with previous findings for surfaces with perfect flatness or small roughness. The Journal of Chemical

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_roughness_liv85">In this work we shall develop a formalism which extends previous calculations of lifetimes of excited molecular states near
                  planar dielectric surfaces and near single small dielectric particles to situations where the molecule is adsorbed on a cluster
                  made of several dielectric spherical grains. The nonradiative relaxation rate is seen to be relatively weakly dependent on
                  the cluster structure and, if the molecule is adsorbed on one of the grains, is well approximated by the single grain result.
                  The radiative decay rate and hence the quantum yield are much more sensitive to the geometry of the cluster which determines
                  the position (in frequency) of the dielectric resonances of the cluster. The formalism developed here may be used to evaluate
                  local field intensities at different positions within a cluster of dielectric grains under the influence of an external incident

                  the organic-inorganic hybrid nanoassemblies suitable for light-harvesting and optoelectronic applications. The nature of charge-transfer
                  interaction of fluorophore with gold surface dictates the pathways with which the excited-state deactivates. Obtaining insight
                  into energy and electron-transfer processes is important to improve the charge separation efficiencies in metal-fluorophore
                  nanoassemblies and photocatalytic activity of metal-semiconductor composites.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_salicylate_alv05">In this work, the role of nanoparticle surface charge in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is examined for the common
                  case of measurements made in colloidal solutions of Ag and Au. Average SERS intensities obtained for several analytes (salicylic
                  acid, pyridine, and 2-naphthalenethiol) on Ag and An colloids are correlated with the pH and zeta potential (xi) values of
                  the nanoparticle solutions from which they were recorded. The consequence of the electrostatic interaction between the analyte
                  and the metallic nanoparticle is stressed. The xi potentials of three commonly used colloidal solutions are reported as a
                  function of pH, and a discussion is given on how these influence SERS intensity. Also examined is the importance of nanoparticle
                  aggregation (and colloidal solution collapse) in determining SERS intensities, and how this varies with the pH of the solution.
                  The results show that SERS enhancement is highest at xi potential values where the colloidal nanoparticle solutions are most
                  stable and where the electrostatic repulsion between the particles and the analyte molecules is minimized. These results suggest
                  some important criteria for consideration in all SERS measurements and also provide important insights into the problem of
                  predicting SERS activities for different molecular systems.

                  surface plasmon spectroscopy and studied as a function of interparticle distance, particle size, and number of particles.
                  In agreement with recent theoretical predictions, a red shift of the surface plasmon resonance occurring in two-dimensional
                  arrays was found for lattice spacings below 200 nm. This red shift is associated with a significant broadening of the resonance
                  and is attributed to the onset of near-field interactions. We found that the relative contributions of the long-range and
                  short-range interactions in two-dimensional arrays of particles are fundamentally different to those occurring in individual
                  linear chains.an

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_scattering_gra95">The design and initial characterization of two-dimensional arrays of colloidal Au particles are reported. These surfaces are
                  prepared by self-assembly of 12 nn diameter colloidal Au particles onto immobilized polymers having pendant functional groups
                  with high affinity for Au (i.e., CN, SH, and NH2). The polymers are formed by condensation of functionalized alkoxysilanes
                  onto cleaned quartz, glass, and SiO2 surfaces. The assembly protocol is carried out completely in solution: cleaned substrates
                  are immersed in methanolic solutions of organosilane, rinsed, and subsequently immersed in aqueous colloidal Au solutions.
                  Two-dimensional arrays spontaneously form on the polymer surface, The resulting substrates have been characterized by UV-vis
                  spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). TEM data show that the
                  particles are spatially separated but close enough to interact electromagnetically (small spacing compared to lambda). The
                  UV-vis data show that collective particle surface plasmon modes are present in the 650-750 nm region, suggesting that these
                  assemblies are SERS-active. This is indeed the case, with enhancement factors of roughly 10(4). Au colloid monolayers possess
                  a set of features that make them very attractive for both basic and applied uses, including uniform roughness, high stability,
                  and biocompatibility.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_scattering_leo05">In the present work a new dye, [Ru(dcbpyH2)2(bpy-TPA2)](PF6)2, and the well-known (Bu4N)2[Ru(dcbpyH)2(NCS)2] complex were
                  investigated. The electronic transitions of both dyes showed solvatochromic shifts due to specific interactions of the ligands
                  with the solvent molecules. The surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectra of the dyes dissolved in water, ethanol, and acetonitrile
                  were measured in silver and gold colloidal solutions. The results demonstrate that the dyes were adsorbed on the metallic
                  nanoparticles in different ways for different solvents. It was also found that in the gold colloid, the aqueous solutions
                  of both dyes did not produce any SERS signal, whereas in ethanolic solution the SERS effect was very weak. Deprotonation,
                  H-bonding, and donor-acceptor interactions seem to determine these different behaviors. Our results indicate the important
                  role of the charge-transfer mechanism in SERS.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_scattering_ler06">We address in this paper the long debated issue of the possibility of vibrational pumping under Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering
                  (SERS) conditions, both theoretically and experimentally. We revisit with simple theoretical models the mechanisms of vibrational
                  pumping and its relation to heating. This presentation provides a clear classification of the various regimes of heating/
                  pumping, from simple global laser heating to selective pumping of a single vibrational mode. We also propose the possibility
                  of extreme pumping driven by stimulated phonon emission, and we introduce and apply a new experimental technique to study
                  these effects in SERS. Our method relies on correlations between Raman peak parameters, and cross-correlation for two Raman
                  peaks. We find strong evidence for local and dynamical heating, but no convincing evidence for selective pumping under our
                  specific experimental SERS conditions.

                  is based on the strong quenching of the fluorescence emission exerted by metallic surfaces on fluorophores positioned in their
                  immediate vicinity (&lt;5 nm). Binding of fluorophore-labeled anti-biotin to biotinylated gold nanoparticles resulted in decreasedfluorescence
                  emission intensity. Subsequent competitive dissociation of labeled anti-biotin with D-biotin resulted in increased fluorescence
                  emission intensity. These interactions occurred by means of specific molecular recognition because when the binding sites
                  of anti-biotin were saturated with D-biotin prior to interaction with the gold nanoparticles; changes in the fluorescence
                  emission intensity were not observed.

                  id="abstract_self_assembled_monolayers_gra95">The design and initial characterization of two-dimensional arrays of colloidal Au particles are reported. These surfaces are
                  prepared by self-assembly of 12 nn diameter colloidal Au particles onto immobilized polymers having pendant functional groups
                  with high affinity for Au (i.e., CN, SH, and NH2). The polymers are formed by condensation of functionalized alkoxysilanes
                  onto cleaned quartz, glass, and SiO2 surfaces. The assembly protocol is carried out completely in solution: cleaned substrates
                  are immersed in methanolic solutions of organosilane, rinsed, and subsequently immersed in aqueous colloidal Au solutions.
                  Two-dimensional arrays spontaneously form on the polymer surface, The resulting substrates have been characterized by UV-vis
                  spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). TEM data show that the
                  particles are spatially separated but close enough to interact electromagnetically (small spacing compared to lambda). The
                  UV-vis data show that collective particle surface plasmon modes are present in the 650-750 nm region, suggesting that these
                  assemblies are SERS-active. This is indeed the case, with enhancement factors of roughly 10(4). Au colloid monolayers possess
                  a set of features that make them very attractive for both basic and applied uses, including uniform roughness, high stability,
                  and biocompatibility.

                  and engineers who wish to use them for the development of new generation nanodevices. Metal nanoparticles such as gold and
                  silver show noticeable photoactivity under UV-visible irradiation as is evident from the photoinduced fusion and fragmentation
                  processes. Binding a photoactive molecule (e.g., pyrene) to metal nanoparticle enhances the photochemical activity and renders
                  the organic-inorganic hybrid nanoassemblies suitable for light-harvesting and optoelectronic applications. The nature of charge-transfer
                  interaction of fluorophore with gold surface dictates the pathways with which the excited-state deactivates. Obtaining insight
                  into energy and electron-transfer processes is important to improve the charge separation efficiencies in metal-fluorophore
                  nanoassemblies and photocatalytic activity of metal-semiconductor composites.

                  id="abstract_self_assembled_monolayers_par03a">Due to their interesting properties, research on colloidal nanocrystals has moved in the last few years from fundamental research
                  to first applications in materials science and life sciences. In this review some recent biological applications of colloidal
                  nanocrystals are discussed, without going into biological or chemical details. First, the properties of colloidal nanocrystals
                  and how they can be synthesized are described. Second, the conjugation of nanocrystals with biological molecules is discussed.
                  And third, three different biological applications are introduced: (i) the arrangement of nanocrystal-oligonucleotide conjugates
                  using molecular scaffolds such as single-stranded DNA, (ii) the use of nanocrystal-protein conjugates as fluorescent probes
                  for cellular imaging, and (iii) a motility assay based on the uptake of nanocrystals by living cells.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_semi_continuous_films_gen03">In this report we show the possibility of broadband low-pass filters with windows of transparency in pre-set spectral ranges.
                  Those filters are based on the unique optical properties of metal-dielectric composites near the percolation threshold. In
                  such composites, metal clusters of different sizes and shapes have different plasmon resonances and resonate nearly independently
                  at different wavelengths. All together, the resonant plasmon modes cover a very broad spectral range. Applying the effect
                  of spectrally selective photo-modification, we develop a procedure that creates mid-infrared windows of transparency within
                  the broadband filters. We also investigate the possibilities of making low-pass filters composed of spheroids and conductive
                  sticks with certain distributions of aspect ratios.

                  id="abstract_semiconductor_nanocrystals_lea02">The linear absorption cross section is a crucial parameter to the design of nanocrystal quantum dot devices and to the interpretation
                  of spectroscopic data. We measure and report the size-dependent absorption cross section of CdSe nanocrystal quantum dots.
                  We compare the results for absorption far above the band edge, where the quantum dot density of states may be approximated
                  as a continuum, to simple theoretical models of light scattering from light-absorbing small particles. Excellent agreement
                  with theory is found for dilute dispersions in hexane. We find that for absorption at 350 nm the per particle absorption cross
                  section C-abs (in cm(2)) for CdSe is C-abs = (5.501 x 10(5))a(3) cm(-1), where a is the particle radius in cm. The absorption
                  cross section is observed to be largely insensitive to the solvent refractive index. Detailed modeling of the effect of the
                  ligand shell may be necessary to understand the lack of sensitivity of the absorption properties of nanocrystal quantum dots
                  to the refractive index of the medium.

                  at the apex of a Si3N4 atomic force microscopy tip by focused ion beam milling. When scanned over the quantum dot, its photoluminescence
                  is enhanced while its excited-state lifetime is decreased. Our observations demonstrate that the relaxation channels of a

                  id="abstract_semiconductor_quantum_dots_gov05">The mechanisms of energy and spin transfer in quantum dot pairs coupled via the Coulomb interaction are studied. Exciton transfer
                  can be resonant or phonon-assisted. In both cases, the transfer rates strongly depend on the resonance conditions. The spin
                  selection rules in the transfer process come from the exchange and spin-orbit interactions. The character of energy dissipation
                  in spin transfer is different than that in the traditional spin currents. The spin-dependent photon cross-correlation functions
                  reflect the exciton transfer process. In addition, a mathematical method to calculate FÃ¶rster transfer in crystalline nanostructures
                  beyond the dipole-dipole approximation is described.

                  DNA is used as a rigid spacer to tune the distance between the two nanoparticles. The width of the fluorescent intensity distribution,
                  monitored at different interparticle distances, reflects both the nanoparticle heterogeneity and the fluorescence intermittency

                  fluorescence of partially quenched CdSe. Our results show that the distance-dependence quenching is compatible with a FÃ¶rster-type

                  to first applications in materials science and life sciences. In this review some recent biological applications of colloidal
                  nanocrystals are discussed, without going into biological or chemical details. First, the properties of colloidal nanocrystals
                  and how they can be synthesized are described. Second, the conjugation of nanocrystals with biological molecules is discussed.
                  And third, three different biological applications are introduced: (i) the arrangement of nanocrystal-oligonucleotide conjugates
                  using molecular scaffolds such as single-stranded DNA, (ii) the use of nanocrystal-protein conjugates as fluorescent probes
                  for cellular imaging, and (iii) a motility assay based on the uptake of nanocrystals by living cells.

                  id="abstract_semiconductor_thin_films_kam02a">Unique electronic and chemical properties of metal nanoparticles have drawn the attention of chemists, physicists, biologists,
                  and engineers who wish to use them for the development of new generation nanodevices. Metal nanoparticles such as gold and
                  silver show noticeable photoactivity under UV-visible irradiation as is evident from the photoinduced fusion and fragmentation
                  processes. Binding a photoactive molecule (e.g., pyrene) to metal nanoparticle enhances the photochemical activity and renders
                  the organic-inorganic hybrid nanoassemblies suitable for light-harvesting and optoelectronic applications. The nature of charge-transfer
                  interaction of fluorophore with gold surface dictates the pathways with which the excited-state deactivates. Obtaining insight
                  into energy and electron-transfer processes is important to improve the charge separation efficiencies in metal-fluorophore
                  nanoassemblies and photocatalytic activity of metal-semiconductor composites.

                  a target polynucleotide is described. In this new nanoparticle-based detection system, Au particles (Â 13 nm diameter), which
                  are capped with 3'- and 5'-(alkanethiol)oligonucleotides, are used to complex a 24-base polynucleotide target. Hybridization
                  of the target with the probes results in the formation of an extended polymeric Au nanoparticle/polynucleotide aggregate,
                  which triggers a red to purple color change in solution. The color change is due to a red shift in the surface plasmon resonance
                  of the Au nanoparticles. The aggregates exhibit characteristic, exceptionally sharp "melting transitions" (monitored at 260
                  or 700 nm), which allows one to distinguish target sequences that contain one base end mismatches, deletions, or an insertion
                  from the fully complementary target. When test solutions are spotted onto a C18 reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography plate,
                  color differentiation is enhanced and a permanent record of the test is obtained, thereby providing a better method for distinguishing
                  the aforementioned target sequences. Significantly, one-pot colorimetric detection of the target in the presence of four strands
                  with single base imperfections can be accomplished with this new probe system

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_sers_alv05">In this work, the role of nanoparticle surface charge in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is examined for the common
                  case of measurements made in colloidal solutions of Ag and Au. Average SERS intensities obtained for several analytes (salicylic
                  acid, pyridine, and 2-naphthalenethiol) on Ag and An colloids are correlated with the pH and zeta potential (xi) values of
                  the nanoparticle solutions from which they were recorded. The consequence of the electrostatic interaction between the analyte
                  and the metallic nanoparticle is stressed. The xi potentials of three commonly used colloidal solutions are reported as a
                  function of pH, and a discussion is given on how these influence SERS intensity. Also examined is the importance of nanoparticle
                  aggregation (and colloidal solution collapse) in determining SERS intensities, and how this varies with the pH of the solution.
                  The results show that SERS enhancement is highest at xi potential values where the colloidal nanoparticle solutions are most
                  stable and where the electrostatic repulsion between the particles and the analyte molecules is minimized. These results suggest
                  some important criteria for consideration in all SERS measurements and also provide important insights into the problem of
                  predicting SERS activities for different molecular systems.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_sers_gou05">In this paper, the fabrication, characterization, and application of unique layer-by-layer (LBL) films of dendrimers and metallic
                  nanoparticles is reported. Silver nanoparticles (d = Â 20 nm) are produced in solution by sodium citrate reduction and incorporated
                  into thin films with generation 1 and 5 DAB-Am dendrimers (polypropylenimine dendrimers with amino surface groups) by the
                  LBL technique. The resulting nanocomposite films are characterized by UV-visible surface plasmon absorption and atomic force
                  microscopy (AFM) measurements, and employed as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of 2-naphthalenethiol.
                  Through variation of the molecular size (dendrimer generation) and concentration of the cross-linker used, as well as the
                  number of layers produced, the optical properties of several different possible architectures are studied. In the films, Ag
                  nanoparticles are shown to be effectively immobilized and stabilized with increased control over their spacing and aggregation.
                  Moreover, the films are shown to be excellent substrates for SERS measurements, demonstrating significant enhancement capability.
                  As expected, large electromagnetic enhancement of Raman scattering signals is found to be strongly dependent on interparticle
                  coupling between neighboring metallic nanoparticles. Finally, the possibility of detecting SERS signals from architectures
                  with intervening layers between the metal nanoparticles and analyte molecules is explored. It is shown that although there
                  are decreases in intensity with increasing number of intervening layers (as is expected from the distance dependence of SERS),
                  electromagnetic enhancement is still able to function at these distances, thus offering the possibility of developing sensors
                  with external layers that are chemically selective for specific analytes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_sers_joh05">We present a general model study of surface-enhanced resonant Raman scattering and fluorescence, focusing on the interplay
                  between electromagnetic (EM) effects and the molecular dynamics as treated by a density matrix calculation. The model molecule
                  has two electronic levels, is affected by radiative and nonradiative damping mechanisms, and a Franck-Condon mechanism yields
                  electron-vibration coupling. The coupling between the molecule and the electromagnetic field is enhanced by placing it between
                  two Ag nanoparticles. The results show that the Raman scattering cross section can, for realistic parameter values, increase
                  by some 10 orders of magnitude (to similar to 10(-14) cm(2)) compared with the free-space case. Also the fluorescence cross
                  section grows with increasing EM enhancement, however, at a slower rate, and this increase eventually stalls when nonradiative
                  decay processes become important. Finally, we find that anti-Stokes Raman scattering is possible with strong incident laser
                  intensities similar to 1 mW/mu m(2).

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_sers_kne98">In agreement with previous results reported for colloidal silver clusters, effective surface-enhanced Raman cross sections
                  of about 10-(16) cm(2) per molecule, corresponding to enhancement factors on the order of 10(14), have also been obtained
                  for molecules attached to colloidal gold clusters. Spatially isolated nearly spherical colloidal gold particles of about 60
                  nm size show maximum enhancement factors on the order of 10(3) at 514 nm excitation, close to the single plasmon resonance.
                  The enhancement factor increases by eleven orders of magnitude when colloidal gold clusters are formed by aggregation of the
                  gold colloids and when near-infrared excitation is applied. The large effective surface-enhanced Raman cross section has been
                  estimated by a straightforward method based on steady-state population redistribution due to the pumping of molecules to the
                  first excited vibrational state via the strongly enhanced Raman process. Our experimental finding confirms the important role
                  of colloidal clusters for extremely large surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement factors. Simultaneously, it
                  suggests colloidal gold clusters as a substrate for high-sensitivity surface-enhanced Raman scattering, which can provide
                  an enhancement level sufficient for Raman single molecule detection. Due to its chemical inactivity, gold might have some
                  advantages compared to silver, particularly in biomedical spectroscopy.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_shapes__structures__and04">We present a model to evaluate the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of electronic excited states of a molecule close to
                  a metal particle of complex shape and, possibly, in the presence of a solvent. The molecule is treated quantum mechanically
                  at Hartree?Fock (HF) or density-functional theory (DFT) level. The metal/solvent is considered as a continuous body, characterized
                  by its frequency dependent local dielectric constant. For simple metal shapes (planar infinite surface and spherical particle)
                  a version of the polarizable continuum model based on the integral equation formalism has been used, while an alternative
                  methodology has been implemented to treat metal particles of arbitrary shape. In both cases, equations have been numerically
                  solved using a boundary element method. Excitation energies and nonradiative decay rates due to the energy transfer from the
                  molecule to the metal are evaluated exploiting the linear response theory (TDHF or TDDFT where TD?time dependent). The radiative
                  decay rate of the whole system (molecule+metal/solvent) is calculated, still using a continuum model, in terms of the response
                  of the surrounding to the molecular transition. The model presented has been applied to the study of the radiative and nonradiative
                  lifetimes of a lissamine molecule in solution (water) and close to gold spherical nanoparticles of different radius. In addition,
                  the influence of the metal shape has been analyzed by performing calculations on a system composed by a coumarin-type molecule
                  close to silver aggregates of complex shape.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_silicon_hud03">A near-field optical imaging approach is demonstrated for simultaneous topographic and spectroscopic imaging with spatial
                  resolution beyond the optical diffraction limit. The method combines metallic-tip-based tapping-mode atomic force microscopy
                  (AFM) with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The AFM metallic tip was formed by sputter coating a Si tapping
                  mode tip with Au, in a way that forms a globular tip apex. Such tip apex generates high local electric field enhancement under
                  laser illumination, which provides a strong electric-field interaction between the AFM tip and the fluorescent molecules under
                  the tip. The tip perturbation of fluorescence gives the fluorescence lifetime changes that provide the AFM-FLIM imaging contrast.
                  A finite element method simulation was used to further evaluate the electric near-field enhancement and electric field distribution
                  originating from the metallic Au-coated AFM tapping-mode tip. We have demonstrated that spatially mapping the change in fluorescence
                  lifetime and intensity is a promising approach to spectroscopic imaging at an AFM spatial resolution typically defined by
                  the apex diameter of the AFM tips. The globular Au-coated AFM tip not only gives adequate spatial AFM tapping-mode imaging
                  spatial resolution but also is "environmentally friendly" to soft samples, such as polymeric dye-labeled nanospheres and even
                  biological specimens such as POPO-3 labeled DNA.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_silver_alv05">In this work, the role of nanoparticle surface charge in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is examined for the common
                  case of measurements made in colloidal solutions of Ag and Au. Average SERS intensities obtained for several analytes (salicylic
                  acid, pyridine, and 2-naphthalenethiol) on Ag and An colloids are correlated with the pH and zeta potential (xi) values of
                  the nanoparticle solutions from which they were recorded. The consequence of the electrostatic interaction between the analyte
                  and the metallic nanoparticle is stressed. The xi potentials of three commonly used colloidal solutions are reported as a
                  function of pH, and a discussion is given on how these influence SERS intensity. Also examined is the importance of nanoparticle
                  aggregation (and colloidal solution collapse) in determining SERS intensities, and how this varies with the pH of the solution.
                  The results show that SERS enhancement is highest at xi potential values where the colloidal nanoparticle solutions are most
                  stable and where the electrostatic repulsion between the particles and the analyte molecules is minimized. These results suggest
                  some important criteria for consideration in all SERS measurements and also provide important insights into the problem of
                  predicting SERS activities for different molecular systems.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_silver_bla04">The spontaneous emission of an excited atom surrounded by different materials is studied in the framework of a semiclassical
                  approach, where the transition dipole moment acts as the source of the emission field. The emission in the presence of semiinfinite
                  media, metallic nanorings, spheres, gratings, and other complex geometries is investigated. Strong emission enhancement effects
                  are obtained in some of these geometries associated to the excitation of plasmons (e.g., in nanorings or spheres). Furthermore,
                  the emission is shown to take place only along narrow angular distributions when the atom is located inside a low-index dielectric
                  and near its planar surface, or when metallic nanogratings are employed at certain resonant wave lengths. In particular, axially
                  symmetric gratings made of real silver metal are considered, and both emission rate enhancement and focused far-field emission
                  are achieved simultaneously when the grating is decorated with further nanostructures.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_silver_cor03">We present a model for the evaluation of the metal-induced deexcitation rate for molecules close to a metal surface. In this
                  model, the molecule is treated quantum mechanically at the density-functional theory level and its excitations with a time-dependent
                  density-functional theory procedure. The metal is described through its dielectric response properties. The nonlocal features
                  of such a response are taken into account by using a modified Lindhard-Mermin dielectric constant. The presence of small random
                  roughness on the metal surface is described with the model of Rahman and Maradudin [Phys. Rev. B 21, 504 (1980)]. Systems
                  in which the molecule close to the metal is immersed in an homogeneous matrix or deposited on a spacer are considered. The
                  matrix and the spacer are treated with the polarizable continuum model. The molecule-metal and the molecule-matrix (or molecule-spacer)
                  electrostatic interactions are described by using the integral equation formalism, numerically treated with a boundary element
                  method. As a test case, the method has been applied to the study of phosphorescence from biacetyl close to a silver surface
                  and immersed in or deposited on solid ammonia. Our results show that nonlocal metal response and surface roughness have an
                  important role in explaining measured lifetimes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_silver_joh05">We present a general model study of surface-enhanced resonant Raman scattering and fluorescence, focusing on the interplay
                  between electromagnetic (EM) effects and the molecular dynamics as treated by a density matrix calculation. The model molecule
                  has two electronic levels, is affected by radiative and nonradiative damping mechanisms, and a Franck-Condon mechanism yields
                  electron-vibration coupling. The coupling between the molecule and the electromagnetic field is enhanced by placing it between
                  two Ag nanoparticles. The results show that the Raman scattering cross section can, for realistic parameter values, increase
                  by some 10 orders of magnitude (to similar to 10(-14) cm(2)) compared with the free-space case. Also the fluorescence cross
                  section grows with increasing EM enhancement, however, at a slower rate, and this increase eventually stalls when nonradiative
                  decay processes become important. Finally, we find that anti-Stokes Raman scattering is possible with strong incident laser
                  intensities similar to 1 mW/mu m(2).

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_silver_kne98">In agreement with previous results reported for colloidal silver clusters, effective surface-enhanced Raman cross sections
                  of about 10-(16) cm(2) per molecule, corresponding to enhancement factors on the order of 10(14), have also been obtained
                  for molecules attached to colloidal gold clusters. Spatially isolated nearly spherical colloidal gold particles of about 60
                  nm size show maximum enhancement factors on the order of 10(3) at 514 nm excitation, close to the single plasmon resonance.
                  The enhancement factor increases by eleven orders of magnitude when colloidal gold clusters are formed by aggregation of the
                  gold colloids and when near-infrared excitation is applied. The large effective surface-enhanced Raman cross section has been
                  estimated by a straightforward method based on steady-state population redistribution due to the pumping of molecules to the
                  first excited vibrational state via the strongly enhanced Raman process. Our experimental finding confirms the important role
                  of colloidal clusters for extremely large surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement factors. Simultaneously, it
                  suggests colloidal gold clusters as a substrate for high-sensitivity surface-enhanced Raman scattering, which can provide
                  an enhancement level sufficient for Raman single molecule detection. Due to its chemical inactivity, gold might have some
                  advantages compared to silver, particularly in biomedical spectroscopy.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_silver_leo05">In the present work a new dye, [Ru(dcbpyH2)2(bpy-TPA2)](PF6)2, and the well-known (Bu4N)2[Ru(dcbpyH)2(NCS)2] complex were
                  investigated. The electronic transitions of both dyes showed solvatochromic shifts due to specific interactions of the ligands
                  with the solvent molecules. The surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectra of the dyes dissolved in water, ethanol, and acetonitrile
                  were measured in silver and gold colloidal solutions. The results demonstrate that the dyes were adsorbed on the metallic
                  nanoparticles in different ways for different solvents. It was also found that in the gold colloid, the aqueous solutions
                  of both dyes did not produce any SERS signal, whereas in ethanolic solution the SERS effect was very weak. Deprotonation,
                  H-bonding, and donor-acceptor interactions seem to determine these different behaviors. Our results indicate the important
                  role of the charge-transfer mechanism in SERS.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_silver_moc02">We present a systematic study of the effect of size and shape on the spectral response of individual silver nanoparticles.
                  An experimental method has been developed that begins with the detection and characterization of isolated nanoparticles in
                  the optical far field. The plasmon resonance optical spectrum of many individual nanoparticles are then correlated to their
                  size and shape using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We find that specific geometrical shapes give distinct
                  spectral responses. In addition, inducing subtle changes in the particles' morphology by heating causes a shift in the individual
                  particle spectrum and provides a simple means of tuning the spectral response to a desired optical wavelength. Improved colloidal
                  preparation methods could potentially lead to homogeneous populations of identical particle shapes and colors. These multicolor
                  colloids could be used as biological labels, surface enhanced Raman scattering substrates, or near field optical microscopy
                  sources covering the full range of wavelengths in the visible spectrum.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_silver_wei83">The enhancements of normal Raman scattering, resonance Raman scattering, and fluorescence from molecules adsorbed on identical,
                  well-characterized, silver-island films are reported. The enhancement arises from the electromagnetic interaction between
                  the molecules and the electronic plasma resonance of the silver islands. A hierarchy of enhancement ratios is found, with
                  typical values of 105 for RS, 103 for RRS and 10?1 to 10 for fluorescence, depending on the quantum yield of the molecular
                  fluorescence. A model, developed on heuristic grounds and substantiated using the density matrix formalism, describes the
                  light scattering processes and the effects of the plasma resonance. This model presents a unified picture of the surface-induced
                  enhancement effects and is consistent with the experimental values. The comparison of all the forms of optical scattering
                  leads to a complete determination of the role of the plasma resonances in the various portions of the scattering process.
                  The excitation of the electronic plasma resonance results in an increased local field at the molecules leading to an increased
                  excitation or absorption rate. Similarly, the excitation of the plasma resonance by the molecular emission dipole results
                  in an increase in the radiative decay rate. However, the electromagnetic coupling of the molecule to the plasma resonance
                  also adds an additional damping channel which can result in a reduction of the absorption or excitation rate as well as the
                  emission yield. The resultant balance of these processes leads to the hierarchy in the measured enhancements. The hierarchy
                  of enhancements is also shown to have important spectroscopic consequences.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_silver_electrode_gou05">In this paper, the fabrication, characterization, and application of unique layer-by-layer (LBL) films of dendrimers and metallic
                  nanoparticles is reported. Silver nanoparticles (d = Â 20 nm) are produced in solution by sodium citrate reduction and incorporated
                  into thin films with generation 1 and 5 DAB-Am dendrimers (polypropylenimine dendrimers with amino surface groups) by the
                  LBL technique. The resulting nanocomposite films are characterized by UV-visible surface plasmon absorption and atomic force
                  microscopy (AFM) measurements, and employed as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of 2-naphthalenethiol.
                  Through variation of the molecular size (dendrimer generation) and concentration of the cross-linker used, as well as the
                  number of layers produced, the optical properties of several different possible architectures are studied. In the films, Ag
                  nanoparticles are shown to be effectively immobilized and stabilized with increased control over their spacing and aggregation.
                  Moreover, the films are shown to be excellent substrates for SERS measurements, demonstrating significant enhancement capability.
                  As expected, large electromagnetic enhancement of Raman scattering signals is found to be strongly dependent on interparticle
                  coupling between neighboring metallic nanoparticles. Finally, the possibility of detecting SERS signals from architectures
                  with intervening layers between the metal nanoparticles and analyte molecules is explored. It is shown that although there
                  are decreases in intensity with increasing number of intervening layers (as is expected from the distance dependence of SERS),
                  electromagnetic enhancement is still able to function at these distances, thus offering the possibility of developing sensors
                  with external layers that are chemically selective for specific analytes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_silver_electrode_gra95">The design and initial characterization of two-dimensional arrays of colloidal Au particles are reported. These surfaces are
                  prepared by self-assembly of 12 nn diameter colloidal Au particles onto immobilized polymers having pendant functional groups
                  with high affinity for Au (i.e., CN, SH, and NH2). The polymers are formed by condensation of functionalized alkoxysilanes
                  onto cleaned quartz, glass, and SiO2 surfaces. The assembly protocol is carried out completely in solution: cleaned substrates
                  are immersed in methanolic solutions of organosilane, rinsed, and subsequently immersed in aqueous colloidal Au solutions.
                  Two-dimensional arrays spontaneously form on the polymer surface, The resulting substrates have been characterized by UV-vis
                  spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). TEM data show that the
                  particles are spatially separated but close enough to interact electromagnetically (small spacing compared to lambda). The
                  UV-vis data show that collective particle surface plasmon modes are present in the 650-750 nm region, suggesting that these
                  assemblies are SERS-active. This is indeed the case, with enhancement factors of roughly 10(4). Au colloid monolayers possess
                  a set of features that make them very attractive for both basic and applied uses, including uniform roughness, high stability,
                  and biocompatibility.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_silver_nanoparticles_kel03">The optical properties of metal nanoparticles have long been of interest in physical chemistry, starting with Faraday's investigations
                  of colloidal gold in the middle 1800s. More recently, new lithographic techniques as well as improvements to classical wet
                  chemistry methods have made it possible to synthesize noble metal nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes, shapes, and dielectric
                  environments. In this feature article, we describe recent progress in the theory of nanoparticle optical properties, particularly
                  methods for solving Maxwell's equations for light scattering from particles of arbitrary shape in a complex environment. Included
                  is a description of the qualitative features of dipole and quadrupole plasmon resonances for spherical particles; a discussion
                  of analytical and numerical methods for calculating extinction and scattering cross-sections, local fields, and other optical
                  properties for nonspherical particles; and a survey of applications to problems of recent interest involving triangular silver
                  particles and related shapes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_silver_nanoparticles_str05">In this work we report on the so-called plasmonic enhancement effect, whereby the presence of metallic surfaces or particles
                  in the vicinity of a fluorophore can dramatically alter the fluorescence emission and absorption properties of a fluorophore.
                  The effect, which is associated with the surface plasmon resonance of the metallic surface, depends on parameters such as
                  metal type, particle size, fluorophore type, and fluorophore-particle separation. This work focuses on the creation of metal
                  nanoparticle arrays by a lithographic process and on optimisation strategies to maximise the fluorescence enhancement of dyes
                  in the vicinity of the nanoparticles, for important applications such as fluorescence-based biochip platforms. Ordered arrays
                  of metallic nano-islands were fabricated on glass substrates by a process of natural lithography using monodisperse polystyrene
                  nanospheres. The metal particle dimensions were tailored in order to tune the plasmon resonance wavelength to match the spectral
                  absorption of the fluorophore. The fluorophore, Cy5 dye, which is widely used in optical immunoassays and has a medium quantum
                  efficiency (similar to 0.3), was used in this preliminary study of the plasmonic enhancement effect. The morphology of the
                  metallic arrays was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Absorption and
                  emission spectroscopies were used to elucidate the enhancement effect and its dependence on metal island morphology. Results
                  were correlated with existing theoretical models. The applicability of this important technique to sensor platforms, such
                  as fluorescence-based biochips, is also discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_single_molecule_mar03">Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements were performed to elucidate the fluorescence quenching of oxazine,
                  rhodamine, carbocyanine, and bora-diaza-indacene dyes by amino acids. Among the natural amino acids, tryptophan exhibits the
                  most pronounced quenching efficiency. Especially, the red-absorbing dyes ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine derivative MR
                  121 are strongly quenched almost exclusively by tryptophan due to the formation of weak or nonfluorescent ground-state complexes
                  with association constants, Kass., ranging from 96 to 206 M-1. Rhodamine, fluorescein, and bora-diaza-indacene derivatives
                  that absorb at shorter wavelengths are also quenched substantially by tyrosine residues. The quenching of carbocyanine dyes,
                  such as Cy5, and Alexa 647 by amino acids can be almost neglected. While quenching of ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine
                  derivative MR121 by tryptophan is dominated by static quenching, dynamic quenching is more efficient for the two bora-diaza-indacene
                  dyes Bodipy-FL and Bodipy630/650. Labeling of the dyes to tryptophan, tryptophan-containing peptides, and proteins (streptavidin)
                  demonstrates that knowledge of these fluorescence quenching processes is crucial for the development of fluorescence-based
                  diagnostic assays. Changes in the fluorescence quantum yield of dye-labeled peptides and proteins might be used advantageously
                  for the quantification of proteases and specific binding partners.

                  id="abstract_single_molecule_detection_mar05">With respect to the origin of single-molecule sensitivity in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), elastic scattering
                  and emission spectra were studied for Ag particles adsorbed with dye or adenine molecules. The scattering peak observed at
                  600-650 nm was extinguished during the inactivation process of the enormous SERS signal, whereas localized surface plasmon
                  (LSP) peaks located at 520 and 730 nm did not change significantly. It was found using a numerical simulation that the additional
                  scattering peak arises from increased electromagnetic coupling between the LSP of adjacent Ag particles through dye molecules
                  located at their junction. In addition, two distinct emission peaks were observed at 550-600 and 600-750 nm only for hot Ag
                  particles with adsorbates. Based on the observations for different surface coverages and on different dye species, these bands
                  were attributed to enhanced radiative decay of LSP and fluorescence of molecules, respectively. Interestingly, adenine molecules
                  on the Ag nanoparticles show similar fluorescence peaks at 600-650 nm, suggesting a charge-transfer state upon adsorption.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_size_sto02">The binding affinity of deoxynucleosides (dA, dG, dC, and dT) to gold nanoparticles was studied using a colorimetric assay
                  to determine if nucleobase sequence may play a role in binding alkanethiol-capped oligonucleotides to gold nanoparticles.
                  These data indicate that the deoxynucleoside dT has a much lower binding affinity to the gold nanoparticle surface than the
                  deoxynucleosides dG, dC, and dA. These data can be correlated with a previous study in our lab which indicated that alkanethiol-capped
                  oligonucleotides containing (dT)20 spacers have a significantly higher surface coverage than oligonucleotides containing (dA)20
                  spacers. To probe the physical consequences of this phenomenon, gold nanoparticles were loaded with alkanethiol-capped poly
                  dT, dA, and dC oligonucleotide sequences of 5-20 bases in length, and the stabilities of the particles in electrolytic media
                  were measured by monitoring a colorimetric change associated with particle agglomeration. The gold nanoparticles loaded with
                  alkanethiol-capped poly dT oligonucleotides exhibited a dramatic increase in stability as the oligonucleotide length was increased
                  from 5 to 20 bases. By comparison, gold nanoparticles loaded with poly dC and poly dA sequences exhibited only a slight increase
                  in stability as the oligonucleotide length was increased. The sequence-dependent stability observed for the DNA-modified gold
                  nanoparticles is attributed to the weaker interaction of the deoxynucleoside dT with the gold nanoparticle surface which results
                  in higher surface coverages and consequently enhanced stability as the oligonucleotide length is increased.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_size_dependence_lea02">The linear absorption cross section is a crucial parameter to the design of nanocrystal quantum dot devices and to the interpretation
                  of spectroscopic data. We measure and report the size-dependent absorption cross section of CdSe nanocrystal quantum dots.
                  We compare the results for absorption far above the band edge, where the quantum dot density of states may be approximated
                  as a continuum, to simple theoretical models of light scattering from light-absorbing small particles. Excellent agreement
                  with theory is found for dilute dispersions in hexane. We find that for absorption at 350 nm the per particle absorption cross
                  section C-abs (in cm(2)) for CdSe is C-abs = (5.501 x 10(5))a(3) cm(-1), where a is the particle radius in cm. The absorption
                  cross section is observed to be largely insensitive to the solvent refractive index. Detailed modeling of the effect of the
                  ligand shell may be necessary to understand the lack of sensitivity of the absorption properties of nanocrystal quantum dots
                  to the refractive index of the medium.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_size_effect_pus06">We present a microscopic model for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) from molecules adsorbed on small noble-metal nanoparticles.
                  In the absence of direct overlap of molecular orbitals and electronic states in the metal, the main enhancement source is
                  the strong electric field of the surface plasmon resonance in a nanoparticle acting on a molecule near the surface. In small
                  particles, the electromagnetic enhancement is strongly modified by quantum-size effects. We show that, in nanometer-sized
                  particles, SERS magnitude is determined by a competition between several quantum-size effects such as the Landau damping of
                  surface plasmon resonance and reduced screening near the nanoparticle surface. Using time-dependent local density approximation,
                  we calculate spatial distribution of local fields near the surface and enhancement factor for different nanoparticles sizes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_sols_gra95">The design and initial characterization of two-dimensional arrays of colloidal Au particles are reported. These surfaces are
                  prepared by self-assembly of 12 nn diameter colloidal Au particles onto immobilized polymers having pendant functional groups
                  with high affinity for Au (i.e., CN, SH, and NH2). The polymers are formed by condensation of functionalized alkoxysilanes
                  onto cleaned quartz, glass, and SiO2 surfaces. The assembly protocol is carried out completely in solution: cleaned substrates
                  are immersed in methanolic solutions of organosilane, rinsed, and subsequently immersed in aqueous colloidal Au solutions.
                  Two-dimensional arrays spontaneously form on the polymer surface, The resulting substrates have been characterized by UV-vis
                  spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). TEM data show that the
                  particles are spatially separated but close enough to interact electromagnetically (small spacing compared to lambda). The
                  UV-vis data show that collective particle surface plasmon modes are present in the 650-750 nm region, suggesting that these
                  assemblies are SERS-active. This is indeed the case, with enhancement factors of roughly 10(4). Au colloid monolayers possess
                  a set of features that make them very attractive for both basic and applied uses, including uniform roughness, high stability,
                  and biocompatibility.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_solvent_effects_and04">We present a model to evaluate the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of electronic excited states of a molecule close to
                  a metal particle of complex shape and, possibly, in the presence of a solvent. The molecule is treated quantum mechanically
                  at Hartree?Fock (HF) or density-functional theory (DFT) level. The metal/solvent is considered as a continuous body, characterized
                  by its frequency dependent local dielectric constant. For simple metal shapes (planar infinite surface and spherical particle)
                  a version of the polarizable continuum model based on the integral equation formalism has been used, while an alternative
                  methodology has been implemented to treat metal particles of arbitrary shape. In both cases, equations have been numerically
                  solved using a boundary element method. Excitation energies and nonradiative decay rates due to the energy transfer from the
                  molecule to the metal are evaluated exploiting the linear response theory (TDHF or TDDFT where TD?time dependent). The radiative
                  decay rate of the whole system (molecule+metal/solvent) is calculated, still using a continuum model, in terms of the response
                  of the surrounding to the molecular transition. The model presented has been applied to the study of the radiative and nonradiative
                  lifetimes of a lissamine molecule in solution (water) and close to gold spherical nanoparticles of different radius. In addition,
                  the influence of the metal shape has been analyzed by performing calculations on a system composed by a coumarin-type molecule
                  close to silver aggregates of complex shape.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_sorptive_properties_wei83">The enhancements of normal Raman scattering, resonance Raman scattering, and fluorescence from molecules adsorbed on identical,
                  well-characterized, silver-island films are reported. The enhancement arises from the electromagnetic interaction between
                  the molecules and the electronic plasma resonance of the silver islands. A hierarchy of enhancement ratios is found, with
                  typical values of 105 for RS, 103 for RRS and 10?1 to 10 for fluorescence, depending on the quantum yield of the molecular
                  fluorescence. A model, developed on heuristic grounds and substantiated using the density matrix formalism, describes the
                  light scattering processes and the effects of the plasma resonance. This model presents a unified picture of the surface-induced
                  enhancement effects and is consistent with the experimental values. The comparison of all the forms of optical scattering
                  leads to a complete determination of the role of the plasma resonances in the various portions of the scattering process.
                  The excitation of the electronic plasma resonance results in an increased local field at the molecules leading to an increased
                  excitation or absorption rate. Similarly, the excitation of the plasma resonance by the molecular emission dipole results
                  in an increase in the radiative decay rate. However, the electromagnetic coupling of the molecule to the plasma resonance
                  also adds an additional damping channel which can result in a reduction of the absorption or excitation rate as well as the
                  emission yield. The resultant balance of these processes leads to the hierarchy in the measured enhancements. The hierarchy
                  of enhancements is also shown to have important spectroscopic consequences.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_spectra_alv05">In this work, the role of nanoparticle surface charge in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is examined for the common
                  case of measurements made in colloidal solutions of Ag and Au. Average SERS intensities obtained for several analytes (salicylic
                  acid, pyridine, and 2-naphthalenethiol) on Ag and An colloids are correlated with the pH and zeta potential (xi) values of
                  the nanoparticle solutions from which they were recorded. The consequence of the electrostatic interaction between the analyte
                  and the metallic nanoparticle is stressed. The xi potentials of three commonly used colloidal solutions are reported as a
                  function of pH, and a discussion is given on how these influence SERS intensity. Also examined is the importance of nanoparticle
                  aggregation (and colloidal solution collapse) in determining SERS intensities, and how this varies with the pH of the solution.
                  The results show that SERS enhancement is highest at xi potential values where the colloidal nanoparticle solutions are most
                  stable and where the electrostatic repulsion between the particles and the analyte molecules is minimized. These results suggest
                  some important criteria for consideration in all SERS measurements and also provide important insights into the problem of
                  predicting SERS activities for different molecular systems.

                  colloid containing Dy3+ were measured. For solution containing Dy3+, fluorescence emission occurs at visible light wavelength
                  region. Two emission peaks are observed at 480 nm and 570 nm respectively when the corresponding excitation wavelength is
                  at 350 nm. When An colloids were added to the solution containing Dy3+, both these two fluorescence peaks were enhanced. Furthermore,
                  with the increasing Au content, the fluorescence increases first and then decreases. We believe that this increased fluorescence
                  are due to the local field enhancement around Dy3+ ions owing to the induced higher orders of surface plasmon resonance. (c)

                  is improved significantly, due to a dramatic decrease of the fluorescence lifetime caused by the strong electromagnetic interaction
                  between the emitting molecule and the metal layer. Moreover, the metal shell enhances the exciting electric field intensity

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_spectroscopy_asl04a">Biotinylated gold nanoparticles were prepared by using a two-step surface modification procedure. First, a carboxyl-terminated
                  alkanethiol was chemisorbed onto the surface of gold nanoparticles in the presence of a stabilizing agent. Subsequently, the
                  carboxyl groups were reacted with (+)-biotinyl-3,6,9,-trioxaundecanediamine and 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol. This procedure resulted
                  in stable, ligand-modified gold nanoparticles. Upon interaction with streptavidin, the biotinylated gold nanoparticles aggregated
                  by means of specific biomolecular recognition. Their aggregation was studied by optical absorption spectroscopy. Controlled
                  aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles resulted in a shift in the surface plasmon resonance peak and broadening of
                  the absorption spectrum of the nanoparticles. The spectral changes were used to assess the extent of aggregation. Aggregation
                  was found to be dependent on the concentrations of streptavidin, biotinylated gold nanoparticles, and the surface mole fraction
                  of biotin groups on the nanoparticles. Maximum aggregation was observed when 24 nM streptavidin and 0.80 nM biotinylated gold
                  nanoparticles were used. Reversal of nanoparticle aggregation was accomplished by the addition of soluble biotin to the streptavidin-nanoparticle
                  aggregates. Kinetic analysis of the absorbance data showed that streptavidin-induced aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles
                  could be interpreted in terms of a Reaction-Limited Colloidal Aggregation (RLCA) model. This indicates that optical absorption
                  spectroscopy can provide a quantitative measurement of the aggregation process.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_spectroscopy_che04">For the first time, an aqueous solution of 32-nm gold nanoparticles (GNPs), to which Nile red (NR) has been noncovalently
                  adsorbed, has been used for sensing thiols. The as-prepared NRGNPs fluoresce weakly as a result of fluorescence resonance
                  energy transfer between NR and the GNPs. The fluorescence of a solution containing NRGNPs at pH 4.0 increases upon the addition
                  of thiols, but not when amines, acids, alcohols, bovine serum albumin, or hemoglobin are added. This phenomenon allows for
                  the selective determination of thiols such as cysteamine and homocysteine, which have limits of detection of 10.2 and 10.9
                  nM, respectively, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. Interestingly, we have found that the excitation (ex = 480 nm), emission
                  (em = 610 nm), and mass spectra (m/z 282) of the substance that desorbs from the GNPs in the presence of thiols are different
                  from those of NR (ex = 580 nm; em = 652 nm; m/z 318), which indicates that a new product forms. When simultaneously conducting
                  fluorescence and colorimetric assays, the selectivity of this approach further improves because at pH 4.0, the color of the
                  NRGNPs does not change in the presence of negatively charged thiols, (e.g., N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine), but changes from
                  maroon to purple and lavender in the presence of neutral thiols (e.g., 3-mercapto-1,2-propanediol) and positively charged
                  thiols (e.g., cysteamine), respectively, as a result of aggregation. This feature allows the types of thiols to be determined
                  at concentrations &gt;1.0 and 0.1 ÂµM by the naked eye and by UV-vis absorption, respectively. Depending on the rate at which
                  the NRGNP color changes, reduced glutathione (slow) is readily distinguishable from oxidized glutathione (no aggregation and
                  no displacement) and from cysteine and homocysteine (fast).

                  we demonstrate that fluorophore-tagged DNA hairpins attached to gold films can function as immobilized "molecular beacons".
                  Two DNA hairpins incorporating portions of the Staphlococcus aureus FemA and mecR methicillin-resistance genes were attached
                  to a gold substrate. Upon exposure to the complement, a Â 26-fold increase in fluorescence intensity was measured corresponding
                  to a 96 Â± 5 quenching efficiency. Studies with nonspecific DNA indicate that DNA hairpins immobilized on a gold surface retain
                  their ability to bind complementary DNA sequences selectively.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_spectroscopy_gou05">In this paper, the fabrication, characterization, and application of unique layer-by-layer (LBL) films of dendrimers and metallic
                  nanoparticles is reported. Silver nanoparticles (d = Â 20 nm) are produced in solution by sodium citrate reduction and incorporated
                  into thin films with generation 1 and 5 DAB-Am dendrimers (polypropylenimine dendrimers with amino surface groups) by the
                  LBL technique. The resulting nanocomposite films are characterized by UV-visible surface plasmon absorption and atomic force
                  microscopy (AFM) measurements, and employed as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of 2-naphthalenethiol.
                  Through variation of the molecular size (dendrimer generation) and concentration of the cross-linker used, as well as the
                  number of layers produced, the optical properties of several different possible architectures are studied. In the films, Ag
                  nanoparticles are shown to be effectively immobilized and stabilized with increased control over their spacing and aggregation.
                  Moreover, the films are shown to be excellent substrates for SERS measurements, demonstrating significant enhancement capability.
                  As expected, large electromagnetic enhancement of Raman scattering signals is found to be strongly dependent on interparticle
                  coupling between neighboring metallic nanoparticles. Finally, the possibility of detecting SERS signals from architectures
                  with intervening layers between the metal nanoparticles and analyte molecules is explored. It is shown that although there
                  are decreases in intensity with increasing number of intervening layers (as is expected from the distance dependence of SERS),
                  electromagnetic enhancement is still able to function at these distances, thus offering the possibility of developing sensors
                  with external layers that are chemically selective for specific analytes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_spectroscopy_gra95">The design and initial characterization of two-dimensional arrays of colloidal Au particles are reported. These surfaces are
                  prepared by self-assembly of 12 nn diameter colloidal Au particles onto immobilized polymers having pendant functional groups
                  with high affinity for Au (i.e., CN, SH, and NH2). The polymers are formed by condensation of functionalized alkoxysilanes
                  onto cleaned quartz, glass, and SiO2 surfaces. The assembly protocol is carried out completely in solution: cleaned substrates
                  are immersed in methanolic solutions of organosilane, rinsed, and subsequently immersed in aqueous colloidal Au solutions.
                  Two-dimensional arrays spontaneously form on the polymer surface, The resulting substrates have been characterized by UV-vis
                  spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). TEM data show that the
                  particles are spatially separated but close enough to interact electromagnetically (small spacing compared to lambda). The
                  UV-vis data show that collective particle surface plasmon modes are present in the 650-750 nm region, suggesting that these
                  assemblies are SERS-active. This is indeed the case, with enhancement factors of roughly 10(4). Au colloid monolayers possess
                  a set of features that make them very attractive for both basic and applied uses, including uniform roughness, high stability,
                  and biocompatibility.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_spectroscopy_hei05">We demonstrate that commercially available unmodified carbocyanine dyes such as Cy5 (usually excited at 633 nm) can be used
                  as efficient reversible single-molecule optical switch, whose fluorescent state after apparent photobleaching can be restored
                  at room temperature upon irradiation at shorter wavelengths. Ensemble photobleaching and recovery experiments of Cy5 in aqueous
                  solution irradiating first at 633 nm, then at 337, 488, or 532 nm, demonstrate that restoration of absorption and fluorescence
                  strongly depends on efficient oxygen removal and the addition of the triplet quencher -mercaptoethylamine. Single-molecule
                  fluorescence experiments show that individual immobilized Cy5 molecules can be switched optically in milliseconds by applying
                  alternating excitation at 633 and 488 nm between a fluorescent and nonfluorescent state up to 100 times with a reliability
                  of &gt;90% at room temperature. Because of their intriguing performance, carbocyanine dyes volunteer as a simple alternative
                  for ultrahigh-density optical data storage. Measurements on single donor/acceptor (tetramethylrhodamine/Cy5) labeled oligonucleotides
                  point out that the described light-driven switching behavior imposes fundamental limitations on the use of carbocyanine dyes
                  as energy transfer acceptors for the study of biological processes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_spectroscopy_joh05">We present a general model study of surface-enhanced resonant Raman scattering and fluorescence, focusing on the interplay
                  between electromagnetic (EM) effects and the molecular dynamics as treated by a density matrix calculation. The model molecule
                  has two electronic levels, is affected by radiative and nonradiative damping mechanisms, and a Franck-Condon mechanism yields
                  electron-vibration coupling. The coupling between the molecule and the electromagnetic field is enhanced by placing it between
                  two Ag nanoparticles. The results show that the Raman scattering cross section can, for realistic parameter values, increase
                  by some 10 orders of magnitude (to similar to 10(-14) cm(2)) compared with the free-space case. Also the fluorescence cross
                  section grows with increasing EM enhancement, however, at a slower rate, and this increase eventually stalls when nonradiative
                  decay processes become important. Finally, we find that anti-Stokes Raman scattering is possible with strong incident laser
                  intensities similar to 1 mW/mu m(2).

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_spectroscopy_ler06">We address in this paper the long debated issue of the possibility of vibrational pumping under Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering
                  (SERS) conditions, both theoretically and experimentally. We revisit with simple theoretical models the mechanisms of vibrational
                  pumping and its relation to heating. This presentation provides a clear classification of the various regimes of heating/
                  pumping, from simple global laser heating to selective pumping of a single vibrational mode. We also propose the possibility
                  of extreme pumping driven by stimulated phonon emission, and we introduce and apply a new experimental technique to study
                  these effects in SERS. Our method relies on correlations between Raman peak parameters, and cross-correlation for two Raman
                  peaks. We find strong evidence for local and dynamical heating, but no convincing evidence for selective pumping under our
                  specific experimental SERS conditions.

                  field at the edge area. The formation of unconventional nanophotonic crescent moon structure is accomplished by using a sacrificial
                  nanosphere template and conventional thin film deposition method, which allows an effective batch nanofabrication and precise
                  controls of nanostructure shapes. Unique multiple scattering peaks are observed in a single gold nanocrescent moon with dark-field
                  white light illumination. A 785 nm near-infrared (NIR) diode laser was used as the excitation source to induce the amplified
                  scattering field on the sharp edge of the single gold nanocrescent moon. The Raman scattering spectrum of Rhodamine 6G molecules
                  adsorbed on the single gold nanocrescent moon are characterized, and the Raman enhancement factor of single gold nanocrescent
                  moon is estimated larger than 10(10), which suggests the potential applications of gold nanocrescent moons in ultrasensitive
                  biomolecular detection and cellular imaging using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_spectroscopy_mor05">Fast and numerically stable transfer-matrix solution is presented for the classical electromagnetics problem of a dipole radiating
                  inside and outside a stratified sphere consisting of concentric spherical shells. There is no limitation on the dipole position,
                  the number of the concentric shells, the shell medium, or on the sphere radius. Electromagnetic fields are determined anywhere
                  in the space, the time-averaged angular distribution of the radiated power, the total radiated power, Ohmic losses due to
                  an absorbing shell, and Green?s function are calculated. An absorbing, optically active, and ultrathin (less, approximate10
                  nm) metallic shell (core), characterized by a nonlocal dielectric function, are all allowed. The classical results are then
                  applied to inelastic light scattering (fluorescence and Raman), the radiative and nonradiative normalized decay rates, and
                  frequency shift. Using correspondence principle, the radiative decay rate is calculated from the Poynting vector, whereas
                  the nonradiative decay rate is calculated from the Ohmic losses inside a sphere absorptive shell. Numerical stability of our
                  method and limitations of classical description of decay rates are addressed. The importance of grouping various radiative
                  and nonradiative decay mechanisms into local and nonlocal decay rates is emphasized. Further possible extensions of the theory
                  presented here to the case of an arbitrary multilayered (axially symmetric) particle and to the classical problem of a radiating
                  quadrupole in the presence of a multilayered particle are briefly outlined. Various applications for chemical speciation,
                  LIDAR, fluorescent microscopy, engineering of decay rates, identification of biological particles, and monitoring specific
                  cell functions are envisaged. Computer program is freely available at http://www.wave-scattering.com.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_spectroscopy_son05">Forster Resonance Energy Transfer has served as a molecular ruler that reports conformational changes and intramolecular distances
                  of single biomolecules(1-4). However, such rulers suffer from low and fluctuating signal intensities, limited observation
                  time due to photobleaching, and an upper distance limit of similar to 10 nm. Noble metal nanoparticles have plasmon resonances
                  in the visible range and do not blink or bleach. They have been employed as alternative probes to overcome the limitations
                  of organic fluorophores(5,6), and the coupling of plasmons in nearby particles has been exploited to detect particle aggregation
                  by a distinct color change in bulk experiments(7-9). Here we demonstrate that plasmon coupling can be used to monitor distances
                  between single pairs of gold and silver nanoparticles. We followed the directed assembly of gold and silver nanoparticle dimers
                  in real time and studied the kinetics of single DNA hybridization events. These 'plasmon rulers' allowed us to continuously
                  monitor separations of up to 70 nm for &gt;3,000 s.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_spectroscopy_xux4">It is well known that surface plasmon absorption (color) of Au nanoparticles highly depends on its size, shape, and surrounding
                  surface environment, providing a great opportunity for the development of Au nanoparticles as a probe for chemical and biochemical
                  sensing and as a building block for nano-optical devices. Currently, it remains incompletely understood how the surface properties
                  of Au nanoparticles ultimately define its optical properties, hindering the progress of rational design of Au nanoparticles
                  for biochemical sensing and assembly of nano-optical devices. Ru(bpy)32+ possesses rich photochemical and electrochemical
                  properties, offering a unique probe to study the surface environment of Au nanoparticles. In this study, we investigate the
                  kinetics of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles (6.5, 19, 48, 97 nm) in the presence of Ru(bpy)32+ at 24.0, 33.0,
                  and 51.0 C. We find that the color-change rate of Au nanoparticles is highly sensitive to the amount of Ru(bpy)32+. In addition,
                  the minimum (critical) concentration of Ru(bpy)32+ needed to change the color of Au nanoparticles is highly dependent upon
                  temperature and nanoparticle size. TEM images illustrate that the color-change mechanism of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+
                  highly depends on the size of nanoparticles. Control experiments using NaCl and MgCl2 to replace Ru(bpy)32+ show no color
                  change, suggesting that the color change of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+ is not solely attributable to the salt
                  effect. Other factors, such as adsorption of Ru(bpy)32+ on the Au nanoparticle surface, may be involved. Moreover, in the
                  presence of the critical concentration of Ru(bpy)32+, as temperature increases from 24.0 C to 51.0 C, the color-change rate
                  of 19 nm Au nanoparticles increases 8-fold, whereas the color-change rate of 48 nm Au nanoparticles decreases 3-fold, showing
                  the temperature dependence of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles in the presence of surface adsorbates, Ru(bpy)32+.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_spheres_leu87">A dynamical approach to the classical decay rates for molecules near a dielectric sphere is presented through the application
                  of the diffraction theory for a dipole antenna established by Van del Pol and Bremmer. This theory is somewhat simpler than
                  but formally equivalent to that established by Ruppin and preserves a feature which is closer to the method of the theory
                  established by Chance, Prock, and Silbey for a flat surface. The results, when compared to those obtained from the static
                  image theory, show that this latter theory can be very inaccurate for large molecule-sphere distances or highly conducting
                  spheres, consistent with previous findings for surfaces with perfect flatness or small roughness. The Journal of Chemical

                  of colloidal gold in the middle 1800s. More recently, new lithographic techniques as well as improvements to classical wet
                  chemistry methods have made it possible to synthesize noble metal nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes, shapes, and dielectric
                  environments. In this feature article, we describe recent progress in the theory of nanoparticle optical properties, particularly
                  methods for solving Maxwell's equations for light scattering from particles of arbitrary shape in a complex environment. Included
                  is a description of the qualitative features of dipole and quadrupole plasmon resonances for spherical particles; a discussion
                  of analytical and numerical methods for calculating extinction and scattering cross-sections, local fields, and other optical
                  properties for nonspherical particles; and a survey of applications to problems of recent interest involving triangular silver

                  id="abstract_spin_orbit_interactions_gov03">We describe a mechanism of spin transfer between individual quantum dots without tunneling. Incident circularly polarized
                  photons create interband excitons with nonzero electron spin in the first quantum dot. When the quantum-dot pair is properly
                  designed, this excitation can be transferred to the neighboring dot via the Coulomb interaction with conservation or flipping
                  of electron spin. The second dot can radiate circularly polarized photons at smaller energy. Selection rules for spin transfer
                  are determined by the resonant conditions and by the strong spin-orbit interaction in the valence band of nanocrystals. Coulomb-induced
                  energy and spin transfer in pairs and chains of dots can become very efficient under resonant conditions. The electron can
                  preserve its spin orientation even in randomly oriented nanocrystals.

                  id="abstract_spin_orbit_interactions_gov05">The mechanisms of energy and spin transfer in quantum dot pairs coupled via the Coulomb interaction are studied. Exciton transfer
                  can be resonant or phonon-assisted. In both cases, the transfer rates strongly depend on the resonance conditions. The spin
                  selection rules in the transfer process come from the exchange and spin-orbit interactions. The character of energy dissipation
                  in spin transfer is different than that in the traditional spin currents. The spin-dependent photon cross-correlation functions
                  reflect the exciton transfer process. In addition, a mathematical method to calculate FÃ¶rster transfer in crystalline nanostructures
                  beyond the dipole-dipole approximation is described.

                  approach, where the transition dipole moment acts as the source of the emission field. The emission in the presence of semiinfinite
                  media, metallic nanorings, spheres, gratings, and other complex geometries is investigated. Strong emission enhancement effects
                  are obtained in some of these geometries associated to the excitation of plasmons (e.g., in nanorings or spheres). Furthermore,
                  the emission is shown to take place only along narrow angular distributions when the atom is located inside a low-index dielectric
                  and near its planar surface, or when metallic nanogratings are employed at certain resonant wave lengths. In particular, axially
                  symmetric gratings made of real silver metal are considered, and both emission rate enhancement and focused far-field emission
                  are achieved simultaneously when the grating is decorated with further nanostructures.

                  nanoparticles in N,N-dimethylformamide. The formation of particle aggregates was observed upon mixing the particle solution
                  with the complex solution, in which the complexes behaved like linker molecules. Luminescent intensity of the complexes was
                  enhanced in the presence of silver nanoparticles, but at only a limited particle concentration region. The observed particle
                  concentration dependences of the luminescent intensity were regarded as the result of a delicate balance between an enhancing
                  and a quenching effect of the silver nanoparticles. In addition to the change in intensity, silver nanoparticles also affected
                  the asymmetric ratio (or monochromaticity) of the europium luminescence. These changes in the luminescent properties of the
                  complex were discussed in terms of the effects of particle aggregates and consequent modifications of the local electromagnetic
                  field, refractive index, and the ligand field around europium ion.

                  to first applications in materials science and life sciences. In this review some recent biological applications of colloidal

                  and how they can be synthesized are described. Second, the conjugation of nanocrystals with biological molecules is discussed.
                  And third, three different biological applications are introduced: (i) the arrangement of nanocrystal-oligonucleotide conjugates
                  using molecular scaffolds such as single-stranded DNA, (ii) the use of nanocrystal-protein conjugates as fluorescent probes
                  for cellular imaging, and (iii) a motility assay based on the uptake of nanocrystals by living cells.

                  id="abstract_stable_carbamate_resins_bay86">A new method for the preparation of a more efficient, stable iminobiotin-containing resin for the isolation of streptavidin
                  was developed. CL-Sepharose was activated with p-nitrophenyl chloroformate, and the resultant carbonate derivative was reacted
                  with diaminohexane. Subsequent reaction of the amino-containing resin with iminobiotin-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (in an organic
                  solvent) yielded the stable affinity resin. The capacity of this resin for either avidin of streptavidin was 12 mg per ml
                  resin, and streptavidin could be purified in one step directly from the culture broth of Streptomyces avidinii. The biotin-binding
                  protein isolated in this manner exhibited a major band at about 75 kDa and a minor band at about 150 kDa. Under denaturing
                  conditions, a spectrum of subunit molecular weights ranging between 15 and 19 kDa was detected, the distributiob of which
                  depended upon the specific preparation.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_state_egg98">The photostability of fluorescent dyes is of crucial importance for the statistical accuracy of single-molecule detection
                  (SMD) and for the image quality of scanning confocal microscopy. Concurrent results for the photostability were obtained by
                  two different experimental techniques. First, the photostabilities of several coumarin and rhodamine derivatives in aqueous
                  solution were obtained by monitoring the steady-state fluorescence decay in a quartz cell. Furthermore, an epi-illuminated
                  microscope, continuous wave (CW) excitation at 514.5 nm, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with a newly developed
                  theory were used to study the photobleaching characteristics of rhodamines under conditions used for SMD. Depending on the
                  rhodamine structure, the probability of photobleaching, pb, is in the order of 10-6-10-7 for irradiances below 103 W/cm2.
                  However, a considerable increase of pb for irradiances above this level was observed which can only be described by photobleaching
                  reactions from higher excited states (two-step photolysis). In view of these observations, the probability of photobleaching,
                  pb, as well as a closed expression of its dependence on the CW excitation irradiance considering a five-level molecular electronic
                  state model with the possibility of photobleaching from higher excited electronic states, is derived. From this model, optimal
                  conditions for SMD with respect to the number of emitted fluorescence photons and to the signal-to-background ratio are discussed,
                  taking into account both saturation and photobleaching. The additional photobleaching due to two-step photolysis limits the
                  applicable irradiance.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_state_leo05">In the present work a new dye, [Ru(dcbpyH2)2(bpy-TPA2)](PF6)2, and the well-known (Bu4N)2[Ru(dcbpyH)2(NCS)2] complex were
                  investigated. The electronic transitions of both dyes showed solvatochromic shifts due to specific interactions of the ligands
                  with the solvent molecules. The surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectra of the dyes dissolved in water, ethanol, and acetonitrile
                  were measured in silver and gold colloidal solutions. The results demonstrate that the dyes were adsorbed on the metallic
                  nanoparticles in different ways for different solvents. It was also found that in the gold colloid, the aqueous solutions
                  of both dyes did not produce any SERS signal, whereas in ethanolic solution the SERS effect was very weak. Deprotonation,
                  H-bonding, and donor-acceptor interactions seem to determine these different behaviors. Our results indicate the important
                  role of the charge-transfer mechanism in SERS.

                  resin, and streptavidin could be purified in one step directly from the culture broth of Streptomyces avidinii. The biotin-binding
                  protein isolated in this manner exhibited a major band at about 75 kDa and a minor band at about 150 kDa. Under denaturing
                  conditions, a spectrum of subunit molecular weights ranging between 15 and 19 kDa was detected, the distributiob of which
                  depended upon the specific preparation.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_streptavidin_fre98">Previous thermodynamic and computational studies have pointed to the important energetic role of aromatic contacts in generating
                  the exceptional binding free energy of streptavidin-biotin association. We report here the crystallographic characterization
                  of single site tryptophan mutants in investigating structural consequences of alterations in these aromatic contacts. Four
                  tryptophan residues, Trp79, Trp92, Trp108 and Trp120, play an important role in the hydrophobic binding contributions, which
                  along with a hydrogen bonding network and a flexible binding loop give rise to tight ligand binding (KaÂ 1013M-1). The crystal
                  structures of ligand-free and biotin-bound mutants, W79F, W108F, W120F and W120A, in the resolution range from 1.9 to 2.3
                  A were determined. Nine data sets for these four different mutants were collected, and structural models were refined to R-values
                  ranging from 0.15 to 0.20. The major question addressed here is how these mutations influence the streptavidin binding site
                  and in particular how they affect the binding mode of biotin in the complex. The overall folding of streptavidin was not significantly
                  altered in any of the tryptophan mutants. With one exception, only minor deviations in the unbound structures were observed.
                  In one crystal form of unbound W79F, there is a coupled shift in the side-chains of Phe29 and Tyr43 toward the mutation site,
                  although in a different crystal form these shifts are not observed. In the bound structures, the orientation of biotin in
                  the binding pocket was not significantly altered in the mutant complex. Compared with the wild-type streptavidin-biotin complex,
                  there were no additional crystallographic water molecules observed for any of the mutants in the binding pocket. These structural
                  studies thus suggest that the thermodynamic alterations can be attributed to the local alterations in binding residue composition,
                  rather than a rearrangement of binding site architectures.

                  id="abstract_structure_of_Amide_I_band_grd02">The secondary structure of bovine serum albumin (BSA) is determined from infrared spectra (cast films, solution in phosphate
                  buffer) by analyzing the structure of Amide bands. Due to strong overlapping of intrinsic bands three classical methods of
                  band decomposition was implemented: Fourier self deconvolution, second derivatives and band fitting algorithm. The initial
                  values for the number of the components and their position was checked with a novel procedure of dry and hydrated H/D exchange.
                  The most dominant band component in Amide I region is the band at 1654 cm-1, which is usually attributed to a-helical structure.
                  Other bands in Amide I region are attributed to various type of turns. Hydration of protein, as well as the solvation of protein
                  in phosphate buffer, induces the radical change in the secondary structure, especially in the population of a-helices. Drying
                  of the protein film causes a partial denaturation. Classical methods for determine the changes in secondary structure are
                  not accurate enough. Moreover, the interpretation of changes can be easily misleading. Hence, the difference spectroscopy
                  was used to clarify the effects of hydration and solvation on the protein secondary structure. The solvated protein was measured
                  in ATR cell. For proper compare the ATR spectrum with the normal transmission one, first optical constant n and k were calculated
                  and later the exact absorption spectrum.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none"
                  id="abstract_submicroscopic_particles_asl05">Gold colloids are well known to display strong plasmon absorption bands due to electron oscillations induced by the incident
                  light. When the colloids are in proximity, the plasmon absorption bands are often perturbed. This has enabled us recently
                  to successfully develop a glucose sensing platform based on the disassociation of dextrancoated gold colloids, cross-linked
                  with Con A, by glucose. However, a much more useful and simpler property of gold colloids, which has been ill explored with
                  regard to sensing, is their ability to efficiently scatter excitation fight. We have found that our nanogold sensing aggregates
                  are indeed efficient light scatters around the nanogold plasmon absorption band. By measuring the ratio of scattered fight
                  intensities at two different arbitrary wavelengths, 560 and 680 nm, glucose concentrations can be readily determined from
                  a few millimolar up to similar to 60 mM, using a simple white light LED and detection system. Further, by measuring the ratio
                  of the scattered intensities, this sensing approach is independent of the total sensing aggregate concentration and the excitation
                  and detection instrumentation fluctuations or drifts. This simplistic and low-cost approach to glucose sensing, coupled with
                  the sensing aggreagates' ability to scatter red light, suggests the potential use of these aggregates for use in physiological
                  transdermal glucose monitoring, either for implantable skin sensors or glucose sensing tattoos (discussed later).

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_surface_bru05">Progress in near-field optical spectroscopy research on metal narroparticles demands a better understanding of the role of
                  particle-particle and tip-sample interactions. In this perspective, we investigate theoretically, at a very moderate level
                  of sophistication, the optical behavior of simple silver nanoparticle aggregates, in terms of a formalism involving a multipolar
                  expansion of the fields involved, along with a simplified model for the optical behavior of nanostructures previously developed.
                  In particular, the tip-sample interaction is taken into account roughly, treating the tip as an additional, single particle,
                  characterized by proper dielectric behavior.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_surface_che04">For the first time, an aqueous solution of 32-nm gold nanoparticles (GNPs), to which Nile red (NR) has been noncovalently
                  adsorbed, has been used for sensing thiols. The as-prepared NRGNPs fluoresce weakly as a result of fluorescence resonance
                  energy transfer between NR and the GNPs. The fluorescence of a solution containing NRGNPs at pH 4.0 increases upon the addition
                  of thiols, but not when amines, acids, alcohols, bovine serum albumin, or hemoglobin are added. This phenomenon allows for
                  the selective determination of thiols such as cysteamine and homocysteine, which have limits of detection of 10.2 and 10.9
                  nM, respectively, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. Interestingly, we have found that the excitation (ex = 480 nm), emission
                  (em = 610 nm), and mass spectra (m/z 282) of the substance that desorbs from the GNPs in the presence of thiols are different
                  from those of NR (ex = 580 nm; em = 652 nm; m/z 318), which indicates that a new product forms. When simultaneously conducting
                  fluorescence and colorimetric assays, the selectivity of this approach further improves because at pH 4.0, the color of the
                  NRGNPs does not change in the presence of negatively charged thiols, (e.g., N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine), but changes from
                  maroon to purple and lavender in the presence of neutral thiols (e.g., 3-mercapto-1,2-propanediol) and positively charged
                  thiols (e.g., cysteamine), respectively, as a result of aggregation. This feature allows the types of thiols to be determined
                  at concentrations &gt;1.0 and 0.1 ÂµM by the naked eye and by UV-vis absorption, respectively. Depending on the rate at which
                  the NRGNP color changes, reduced glutathione (slow) is readily distinguishable from oxidized glutathione (no aggregation and
                  no displacement) and from cysteine and homocysteine (fast).

                  (Os(bpy)(3)(2+)) as phosphorescent labels for the quantification of surface binding of molecules to gold and silver nanoparticles.
                  The fraction of Rtt(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) that is in solution can be distinguished from the surface-bound fraction
                  by the relative lifetimes and integrated emission yields as determined by time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) spectroscopy.
                  Complementary steady-state measurements were carried out to confirm surface attachment of the phosphorescent label molecules.
                  Although the emission of solutions of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) is quenched proportional to the concentration of 10
                  nm Au or 20 nm Ag nanoparticles, the quenching is static and not diffusional quenching observed in Stern-Volmer plots. The
                  results demonstrate that time-resolved spectroscopy provides a rapid method for the measurement of surface binding of labeled
                  molecules on metallic nanoparticles. While steady-state measurements require the preparation of a series of samples with varying
                  quencher concentrations and a reference, the method described herein requires a single sample plus reference. The mechanism
                  for phosphorescence quenching on Au and Ag nanoparticles is discussed in terms of energy and electron transfer theories.

                  optical illumination to detect DNA hybridization events occurred on the chip surface. The method utilizes gold nanoparticle
                  labeling and silver enhancement to generate opaque surface at area with target DNA hybridization. A photodiode fabricated
                  underneath the supporting surface can then be used to detect the light intensity changes, before and after the silver enhancement.
                  With this technique, we have successfully discriminated single base-mismatched DNA from matched DNA sequence, and the detection
                  limit could be as low as 10 pM. By exploiting the advanced modern IC manufacturing technology and the well-established electrochemical
                  immobilization of DNA, this approach has the potential to be used to construct a portable high-density DNA nanoarray system

                  nanoparticles in N,N-dimethylformamide. The formation of particle aggregates was observed upon mixing the particle solution
                  with the complex solution, in which the complexes behaved like linker molecules. Luminescent intensity of the complexes was
                  enhanced in the presence of silver nanoparticles, but at only a limited particle concentration region. The observed particle
                  concentration dependences of the luminescent intensity were regarded as the result of a delicate balance between an enhancing
                  and a quenching effect of the silver nanoparticles. In addition to the change in intensity, silver nanoparticles also affected
                  the asymmetric ratio (or monochromaticity) of the europium luminescence. These changes in the luminescent properties of the
                  complex were discussed in terms of the effects of particle aggregates and consequent modifications of the local electromagnetic
                  field, refractive index, and the ligand field around europium ion.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_surface_str05">In this work we report on the so-called plasmonic enhancement effect, whereby the presence of metallic surfaces or particles
                  in the vicinity of a fluorophore can dramatically alter the fluorescence emission and absorption properties of a fluorophore.
                  The effect, which is associated with the surface plasmon resonance of the metallic surface, depends on parameters such as
                  metal type, particle size, fluorophore type, and fluorophore-particle separation. This work focuses on the creation of metal
                  nanoparticle arrays by a lithographic process and on optimisation strategies to maximise the fluorescence enhancement of dyes
                  in the vicinity of the nanoparticles, for important applications such as fluorescence-based biochip platforms. Ordered arrays
                  of metallic nano-islands were fabricated on glass substrates by a process of natural lithography using monodisperse polystyrene
                  nanospheres. The metal particle dimensions were tailored in order to tune the plasmon resonance wavelength to match the spectral
                  absorption of the fluorophore. The fluorophore, Cy5 dye, which is widely used in optical immunoassays and has a medium quantum
                  efficiency (similar to 0.3), was used in this preliminary study of the plasmonic enhancement effect. The morphology of the
                  metallic arrays was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Absorption and
                  emission spectroscopies were used to elucidate the enhancement effect and its dependence on metal island morphology. Results
                  were correlated with existing theoretical models. The applicability of this important technique to sensor platforms, such
                  as fluorescence-based biochips, is also discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

                  is based on the strong quenching of the fluorescence emission exerted by metallic surfaces on fluorophores positioned in their
                  immediate vicinity (&lt;5 nm). Binding of fluorophore-labeled anti-biotin to biotinylated gold nanoparticles resulted in decreasedfluorescence
                  emission intensity. Subsequent competitive dissociation of labeled anti-biotin with D-biotin resulted in increased fluorescence
                  emission intensity. These interactions occurred by means of specific molecular recognition because when the binding sites
                  of anti-biotin were saturated with D-biotin prior to interaction with the gold nanoparticles; changes in the fluorescence
                  emission intensity were not observed.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_surface_plasmon_mar05">With respect to the origin of single-molecule sensitivity in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), elastic scattering
                  and emission spectra were studied for Ag particles adsorbed with dye or adenine molecules. The scattering peak observed at
                  600-650 nm was extinguished during the inactivation process of the enormous SERS signal, whereas localized surface plasmon
                  (LSP) peaks located at 520 and 730 nm did not change significantly. It was found using a numerical simulation that the additional
                  scattering peak arises from increased electromagnetic coupling between the LSP of adjacent Ag particles through dye molecules
                  located at their junction. In addition, two distinct emission peaks were observed at 550-600 and 600-750 nm only for hot Ag
                  particles with adsorbates. Based on the observations for different surface coverages and on different dye species, these bands
                  were attributed to enhanced radiative decay of LSP and fluorescence of molecules, respectively. Interestingly, adenine molecules
                  on the Ag nanoparticles show similar fluorescence peaks at 600-650 nm, suggesting a charge-transfer state upon adsorption.

                  that, in the case of gold tips, the enhancement is due to resonant plasmon excitation. Consistently, no enhancement has been

                  selected and manipulated with a micromanipulator installed inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM). With typical particle
                  dimensions of some 100 nm, the plasma resonances of particles and the coupled modes of particle pairs were observed in the
                  visible region. The polarization dependence of the resonance frequencies strongly reflects the shape anisotropy; the effect

                  the results are in good agreement with the analytical calculations by Mie scattering, and with numerical calculations by the
                  finite-difference time-domain method, both of which are performed with the morphological parameters obtained from the SEM

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_surface_spectroscopy_mos05">The electromagnetic theory of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), despite its simplicity, can account for all major
                  SERS observations, including: the need for a nanostructured material as the SERS-active system; the observation that some
                  metals form good SERS-active systems while others do not; the observation that strongly interacting metal nanoparticles result
                  in very much more effective SERS-active systems; the observed polarization sensitivity shown by nanoparticle aggregates; and
                  the optical behavior of nanostructured metals in the absence of a molecular adsorbate. By extending the ideas inherent in
                  the electromagnetic model one can also understand the seminal features reported for single-molecule SERS, including the puzzling
                  observation that only a few silver particles in an ensemble are hot (they are appropriately structured nanoparticle clusters)
                  and that for a hot particle, once one is able to observe SERS, adding more adsorbate does not significantly alter the intensity
                  (once the electromagnetic hot spot is occupied, adding adsorbate to other sites on the nanoparticle cluster will not add greatly
                  to the observed intensity). However, the electromagnetic model does not account for all that is learned through SERS. Molecular
                  resonances, charge-transfer transitions and other processes such as ballistic electrons transiently probing the region where
                  the molecule resides and then modulating electronic processes of the metal as a result certainly contribute to the rich information
                  SERS reports; and by virtue of the fact that these contributions will vary from molecule to molecule, they will constitute
                  the most interesting aspects reported by SERS. But, the overall reason why SERS produces such inordinate enhancements is largely
                  an electromagnetic property of nanostructures.

                  and rate equation formalisms, we show that, for surface coverages at which the surface immobilized molecules interact, barriers
                  to penetration create a distribution of target molecule concentrations within the adsorbed layer. By approximately enumerating
                  probe and target conformations, we estimate the probability of overlap between complementary probe and target regions as a
                  function of probe density and chain length. In agreement with experiments, we find that as probe molecules interact more strongly,
                  fewer nucleation sites become accessible and binding rates are diminished relative to those in solution. Nucleation sites
                  near the grafted end of the probes are least accessible; thus targets which preferentially bind to this region show more drastic
                  rate reductions than those that bind near the free end of the probe. The implications of these results for DNA-based biosensors

                  id="abstract_surface_enhanced_Raman_scattering_mar05">With respect to the origin of single-molecule sensitivity in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), elastic scattering
                  and emission spectra were studied for Ag particles adsorbed with dye or adenine molecules. The scattering peak observed at
                  600-650 nm was extinguished during the inactivation process of the enormous SERS signal, whereas localized surface plasmon
                  (LSP) peaks located at 520 and 730 nm did not change significantly. It was found using a numerical simulation that the additional
                  scattering peak arises from increased electromagnetic coupling between the LSP of adjacent Ag particles through dye molecules
                  located at their junction. In addition, two distinct emission peaks were observed at 550-600 and 600-750 nm only for hot Ag
                  particles with adsorbates. Based on the observations for different surface coverages and on different dye species, these bands
                  were attributed to enhanced radiative decay of LSP and fluorescence of molecules, respectively. Interestingly, adenine molecules
                  on the Ag nanoparticles show similar fluorescence peaks at 600-650 nm, suggesting a charge-transfer state upon adsorption.

                  id="abstract_surface_enhanced_raman_gra95">The design and initial characterization of two-dimensional arrays of colloidal Au particles are reported. These surfaces are
                  prepared by self-assembly of 12 nn diameter colloidal Au particles onto immobilized polymers having pendant functional groups
                  with high affinity for Au (i.e., CN, SH, and NH2). The polymers are formed by condensation of functionalized alkoxysilanes
                  onto cleaned quartz, glass, and SiO2 surfaces. The assembly protocol is carried out completely in solution: cleaned substrates
                  are immersed in methanolic solutions of organosilane, rinsed, and subsequently immersed in aqueous colloidal Au solutions.
                  Two-dimensional arrays spontaneously form on the polymer surface, The resulting substrates have been characterized by UV-vis
                  spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). TEM data show that the
                  particles are spatially separated but close enough to interact electromagnetically (small spacing compared to lambda). The
                  UV-vis data show that collective particle surface plasmon modes are present in the 650-750 nm region, suggesting that these
                  assemblies are SERS-active. This is indeed the case, with enhancement factors of roughly 10(4). Au colloid monolayers possess
                  a set of features that make them very attractive for both basic and applied uses, including uniform roughness, high stability,
                  and biocompatibility.

                  (SERS) conditions, both theoretically and experimentally. We revisit with simple theoretical models the mechanisms of vibrational
                  pumping and its relation to heating. This presentation provides a clear classification of the various regimes of heating/
                  pumping, from simple global laser heating to selective pumping of a single vibrational mode. We also propose the possibility
                  of extreme pumping driven by stimulated phonon emission, and we introduce and apply a new experimental technique to study
                  these effects in SERS. Our method relies on correlations between Raman peak parameters, and cross-correlation for two Raman
                  peaks. We find strong evidence for local and dynamical heating, but no convincing evidence for selective pumping under our
                  specific experimental SERS conditions.

                  For the functionalization, AuNPs were first stabilized by chemisorption of n-alkanethiols and then capped with the first generation
                  polyamidoamine (G1 PAMAM) dendrimers. By employing a streptavidin-biotin couple as a model system, avidin was quantitatively
                  analyzed as an inhibitor by sensing the change in photoluminescence (PL) quenching of SA-QDs by biotin-AuNPs. The detection
                  limit for avidin was about 10 nM. It is anticipated that the PL quenching-based sensing system can be used for the quantitative
                  analysis and high throughput screening of molecules which inhibit the specific biomolecular interactions.

                  id="abstract_surface_plasmon_excitation_kam02a">Unique electronic and chemical properties of metal nanoparticles have drawn the attention of chemists, physicists, biologists,
                  and engineers who wish to use them for the development of new generation nanodevices. Metal nanoparticles such as gold and
                  silver show noticeable photoactivity under UV-visible irradiation as is evident from the photoinduced fusion and fragmentation
                  processes. Binding a photoactive molecule (e.g., pyrene) to metal nanoparticle enhances the photochemical activity and renders
                  the organic-inorganic hybrid nanoassemblies suitable for light-harvesting and optoelectronic applications. The nature of charge-transfer
                  interaction of fluorophore with gold surface dictates the pathways with which the excited-state deactivates. Obtaining insight
                  into energy and electron-transfer processes is important to improve the charge separation efficiencies in metal-fluorophore
                  nanoassemblies and photocatalytic activity of metal-semiconductor composites.

                  such as proteins (enzymes, antigens, antibodies) or DNA. The integration of nanoparticles, which exhibit unique electronic,
                  photonic, and catalytic properties, with biomaterials, which display unique recognition, catalytic, and inhibition properties,
                  yields novel hybrid nanobiomaterials of synergetic properties and functions. This review describes recent advances in the
                  synthesis of biomolecule-nanoparticle/nanorod hybrid systems and the application of such assemblies in the generation of 2D
                  and 3D ordered structures in solutions and on surfaces. Particular emphasis is directed to the use of biomolecule-nanoparticle
                  (metallic or semiconductive) assemblies for bioanalytical applications and for the fabrication of bioelectronic devices.

                  id="abstract_surface_plasmon_resonance_kel03">The optical properties of metal nanoparticles have long been of interest in physical chemistry, starting with Faraday's investigations
                  of colloidal gold in the middle 1800s. More recently, new lithographic techniques as well as improvements to classical wet
                  chemistry methods have made it possible to synthesize noble metal nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes, shapes, and dielectric
                  environments. In this feature article, we describe recent progress in the theory of nanoparticle optical properties, particularly
                  methods for solving Maxwell's equations for light scattering from particles of arbitrary shape in a complex environment. Included
                  is a description of the qualitative features of dipole and quadrupole plasmon resonances for spherical particles; a discussion
                  of analytical and numerical methods for calculating extinction and scattering cross-sections, local fields, and other optical
                  properties for nonspherical particles; and a survey of applications to problems of recent interest involving triangular silver
                  particles and related shapes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_surfaces_asl04a">Biotinylated gold nanoparticles were prepared by using a two-step surface modification procedure. First, a carboxyl-terminated
                  alkanethiol was chemisorbed onto the surface of gold nanoparticles in the presence of a stabilizing agent. Subsequently, the
                  carboxyl groups were reacted with (+)-biotinyl-3,6,9,-trioxaundecanediamine and 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol. This procedure resulted
                  in stable, ligand-modified gold nanoparticles. Upon interaction with streptavidin, the biotinylated gold nanoparticles aggregated
                  by means of specific biomolecular recognition. Their aggregation was studied by optical absorption spectroscopy. Controlled
                  aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles resulted in a shift in the surface plasmon resonance peak and broadening of
                  the absorption spectrum of the nanoparticles. The spectral changes were used to assess the extent of aggregation. Aggregation
                  was found to be dependent on the concentrations of streptavidin, biotinylated gold nanoparticles, and the surface mole fraction
                  of biotin groups on the nanoparticles. Maximum aggregation was observed when 24 nM streptavidin and 0.80 nM biotinylated gold
                  nanoparticles were used. Reversal of nanoparticle aggregation was accomplished by the addition of soluble biotin to the streptavidin-nanoparticle
                  aggregates. Kinetic analysis of the absorbance data showed that streptavidin-induced aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles
                  could be interpreted in terms of a Reaction-Limited Colloidal Aggregation (RLCA) model. This indicates that optical absorption
                  spectroscopy can provide a quantitative measurement of the aggregation process.

                  of the diffraction theory for a dipole antenna established by Van del Pol and Bremmer. This theory is somewhat simpler than
                  but formally equivalent to that established by Ruppin and preserves a feature which is closer to the method of the theory
                  established by Chance, Prock, and Silbey for a flat surface. The results, when compared to those obtained from the static
                  image theory, show that this latter theory can be very inaccurate for large molecule-sphere distances or highly conducting
                  spheres, consistent with previous findings for surfaces with perfect flatness or small roughness. The Journal of Chemical

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_surfaces_liv85">In this work we shall develop a formalism which extends previous calculations of lifetimes of excited molecular states near
                  planar dielectric surfaces and near single small dielectric particles to situations where the molecule is adsorbed on a cluster
                  made of several dielectric spherical grains. The nonradiative relaxation rate is seen to be relatively weakly dependent on
                  the cluster structure and, if the molecule is adsorbed on one of the grains, is well approximated by the single grain result.
                  The radiative decay rate and hence the quantum yield are much more sensitive to the geometry of the cluster which determines
                  the position (in frequency) of the dielectric resonances of the cluster. The formalism developed here may be used to evaluate
                  local field intensities at different positions within a cluster of dielectric grains under the influence of an external incident
                  field. The Journal of Chemical Physics is copyrighted by The American Institute of Physics.

                  well-characterized, silver-island films are reported. The enhancement arises from the electromagnetic interaction between
                  the molecules and the electronic plasma resonance of the silver islands. A hierarchy of enhancement ratios is found, with
                  typical values of 105 for RS, 103 for RRS and 10?1 to 10 for fluorescence, depending on the quantum yield of the molecular
                  fluorescence. A model, developed on heuristic grounds and substantiated using the density matrix formalism, describes the
                  light scattering processes and the effects of the plasma resonance. This model presents a unified picture of the surface-induced
                  enhancement effects and is consistent with the experimental values. The comparison of all the forms of optical scattering
                  leads to a complete determination of the role of the plasma resonances in the various portions of the scattering process.
                  The excitation of the electronic plasma resonance results in an increased local field at the molecules leading to an increased
                  excitation or absorption rate. Similarly, the excitation of the plasma resonance by the molecular emission dipole results
                  in an increase in the radiative decay rate. However, the electromagnetic coupling of the molecule to the plasma resonance
                  also adds an additional damping channel which can result in a reduction of the absorption or excitation rate as well as the
                  emission yield. The resultant balance of these processes leads to the hierarchy in the measured enhancements. The hierarchy
                  of enhancements is also shown to have important spectroscopic consequences.

                  nanoparticles in N,N-dimethylformamide. The formation of particle aggregates was observed upon mixing the particle solution
                  with the complex solution, in which the complexes behaved like linker molecules. Luminescent intensity of the complexes was
                  enhanced in the presence of silver nanoparticles, but at only a limited particle concentration region. The observed particle
                  concentration dependences of the luminescent intensity were regarded as the result of a delicate balance between an enhancing
                  and a quenching effect of the silver nanoparticles. In addition to the change in intensity, silver nanoparticles also affected
                  the asymmetric ratio (or monochromaticity) of the europium luminescence. These changes in the luminescent properties of the
                  complex were discussed in terms of the effects of particle aggregates and consequent modifications of the local electromagnetic
                  field, refractive index, and the ligand field around europium ion.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_thin_ag_films_gra95">The design and initial characterization of two-dimensional arrays of colloidal Au particles are reported. These surfaces are
                  prepared by self-assembly of 12 nn diameter colloidal Au particles onto immobilized polymers having pendant functional groups
                  with high affinity for Au (i.e., CN, SH, and NH2). The polymers are formed by condensation of functionalized alkoxysilanes
                  onto cleaned quartz, glass, and SiO2 surfaces. The assembly protocol is carried out completely in solution: cleaned substrates
                  are immersed in methanolic solutions of organosilane, rinsed, and subsequently immersed in aqueous colloidal Au solutions.
                  Two-dimensional arrays spontaneously form on the polymer surface, The resulting substrates have been characterized by UV-vis
                  spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). TEM data show that the
                  particles are spatially separated but close enough to interact electromagnetically (small spacing compared to lambda). The
                  UV-vis data show that collective particle surface plasmon modes are present in the 650-750 nm region, suggesting that these
                  assemblies are SERS-active. This is indeed the case, with enhancement factors of roughly 10(4). Au colloid monolayers possess
                  a set of features that make them very attractive for both basic and applied uses, including uniform roughness, high stability,
                  and biocompatibility.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_time_joh05">We present a general model study of surface-enhanced resonant Raman scattering and fluorescence, focusing on the interplay
                  between electromagnetic (EM) effects and the molecular dynamics as treated by a density matrix calculation. The model molecule
                  has two electronic levels, is affected by radiative and nonradiative damping mechanisms, and a Franck-Condon mechanism yields
                  electron-vibration coupling. The coupling between the molecule and the electromagnetic field is enhanced by placing it between
                  two Ag nanoparticles. The results show that the Raman scattering cross section can, for realistic parameter values, increase
                  by some 10 orders of magnitude (to similar to 10(-14) cm(2)) compared with the free-space case. Also the fluorescence cross
                  section grows with increasing EM enhancement, however, at a slower rate, and this increase eventually stalls when nonradiative
                  decay processes become important. Finally, we find that anti-Stokes Raman scattering is possible with strong incident laser
                  intensities similar to 1 mW/mu m(2).

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_time_resolved_spectra_dul02">The radiative and nonradiative decay rates of lissamine dye molecules, chemically attached to differently sized gold nanoparticles,
                  are investigated by means of time-resolved fluorescence experiments. A pronounced fluorescence quenching is observed already
                  for the smallest nanoparticles of 1 nm radius. The quenching is caused not only by an increased nonradiative rate but, equally
                  important, by a drastic decrease in the dye's radiative rate. Assuming resonant energy transfer to be responsible for the
                  nonradiative decay channel, we compare our experimental findings with theoretical results derived from the Gersten-Nitzan
                  model.

                  id="abstract_time_resolved_fluorescence_sey05">Efforts to improve the performance of immunoassays and immunosensors by incorporating different kinds of nanostructures have
                  gained considerable momentum over the last decade. Apart from liposomes, which will not be discussed here, most groups focus
                  on artificial, particulate marker systems, both organic and inorganic. The underlying detection procedures may be based either
                  on electro-magnetical or optical techniques. This review will be confined to the latter only, comprising nanoparticle applications
                  generating signals as diverse as static and time-resolved luminescence, one- and two-photon absorption, Raman and Rayleigh
                  scattering as well as surface plasmon resonance and others. In general, all endeavors cited are geared to achieve one or more
                  of the following goals: lowering of detection limits (if possible, down to single-molecule level), parallel integration of
                  multiple signals (multiplexing), signal amplification by several orders of magnitude and prevention of photobleaching effects
                  with concomitant maintenance of antigen binding specificity and sensitivity. Inorganic nanoparticle labels based on noble
                  metals, semiconductor quantum dots and nanoshells appear to be the most versatile systems for these bioanalytical applications
                  of nanophotonics. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

                  with nearly identical absorption and emission characteristics but different fluorescent lifetimes and quantum yields, so called
                  multiplex dyes. Optical excitation of the rhodamine chromophor induces an intramolecular electron transfer between the rhodamine
                  subunit and the quenching molecule. As predicted by the classical theory of electron transfer we can control the rate of electron
                  transfer by the distance between the donor and the acceptor, e.g. different coupling positions and spacers, and the polarity
                  of the surrounding medium. We investigated the following quenchers: m-, o- and p-nitrobenzylamine, p-dimethylaminobenzylamine
                  and p-methoxybenzylamine.

                  demand for new efficient fluorescence labels in this wavelength region. Here some problems arise due to the fact that with
                  increasing absorption wavelength the fluorescence quantum yield drastically decreases, especially in aqueous media. Additionally,
                  organic dyes may aggregate and show non-specific agginities to biological materials. We investigate the interactions of recently
                  developed fluorescent dyes and two commercially available fluorescent dyes with the DNA base guanosine. The results obtained
                  in intermolecular quenching experiments reveal various fluorescence quenching effects. Due to the increasing hydrophobicity
                  of fluorescent dyes with increasing molecular size the aggregation tendency with biological materials also increases. Therefore
                  ground and excited state interactions increase thus promoting the observed fluorescence quenching.

                  has led us to current efforts to develop new efficient fluorescent labels for biodiagnostics with absorption and emission
                  beyond 600 nm. In view of the general fluorescence decrease with increasing emission wavelength, we investigated the possibility
                  to shift the absorption of rhodamine dyes toward the region 620-670 nm. The hydrophobic nature of all known long-wavelength
                  dyes results in the tendency to form intra- and intermolecular aggregates in hydrophilic solvents, especially in aqueous environment.
                  Due to the aggregation with biological materials, fluorescence quenching of the dyes is often observed. New strategies for
                  prevention of these processes are considered.

                  investigated. The electronic transitions of both dyes showed solvatochromic shifts due to specific interactions of the ligands
                  with the solvent molecules. The surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectra of the dyes dissolved in water, ethanol, and acetonitrile
                  were measured in silver and gold colloidal solutions. The results demonstrate that the dyes were adsorbed on the metallic
                  nanoparticles in different ways for different solvents. It was also found that in the gold colloid, the aqueous solutions
                  of both dyes did not produce any SERS signal, whereas in ethanolic solution the SERS effect was very weak. Deprotonation,
                  H-bonding, and donor-acceptor interactions seem to determine these different behaviors. Our results indicate the important
                  role of the charge-transfer mechanism in SERS.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_tool_lij05">In this paper, we had proposed a silicon integrated circuit (IC) compatible DNA-detection platform using photodiode and ordinary
                  optical illumination to detect DNA hybridization events occurred on the chip surface. The method utilizes gold nanoparticle
                  labeling and silver enhancement to generate opaque surface at area with target DNA hybridization. A photodiode fabricated
                  underneath the supporting surface can then be used to detect the light intensity changes, before and after the silver enhancement.
                  With this technique, we have successfully discriminated single base-mismatched DNA from matched DNA sequence, and the detection
                  limit could be as low as 10 pM. By exploiting the advanced modern IC manufacturing technology and the well-established electrochemical
                  immobilization of DNA, this approach has the potential to be used to construct a portable high-density DNA nanoarray system

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_tool_yun05">Optical-based distance measurements are essential for tracking biomolecular conformational changes, drug discovery, and cell
                  biology. {T}raditional {F}Ã¶rster resonance energy transfer ({FRET}) is efficient for separation distances up to 100 {\AA}.
                  {W}e report the first successful application of a dipole-surface type energy transfer from a molecular dipole to a nanometal
                  surface that more than doubles the traditional {F}Ã¶rster range (220 {\AA}) and follows a 1/{R}4 distance dependence. {W}e
                  appended a 1.4 nm {A}u cluster to the 5' end of one {DNA} strand as the energy acceptor and a fluorescein ({FAM}) to the 5'
                  end of the complementary strand as the energy donor. {A}nalysis of the energy transfer on {DNA} lengths (15, 20, 30, 60bp),
                  complemented by protein-induced {DNA} bending, provides the basis for fully mapping the extent of this dipole surface type
                  mechanism over its entire usable range (50-250 {\AA}). {F}urther, protein function is fully compatible with these nanometal-{DNA}
                  constructs. {S}ignificantly extending the range of optical based methods in molecular rulers is an important leap forward
                  for biophysics.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_total_homocysteine_che04">For the first time, an aqueous solution of 32-nm gold nanoparticles (GNPs), to which Nile red (NR) has been noncovalently
                  adsorbed, has been used for sensing thiols. The as-prepared NRGNPs fluoresce weakly as a result of fluorescence resonance
                  energy transfer between NR and the GNPs. The fluorescence of a solution containing NRGNPs at pH 4.0 increases upon the addition
                  of thiols, but not when amines, acids, alcohols, bovine serum albumin, or hemoglobin are added. This phenomenon allows for
                  the selective determination of thiols such as cysteamine and homocysteine, which have limits of detection of 10.2 and 10.9
                  nM, respectively, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. Interestingly, we have found that the excitation (ex = 480 nm), emission
                  (em = 610 nm), and mass spectra (m/z 282) of the substance that desorbs from the GNPs in the presence of thiols are different
                  from those of NR (ex = 580 nm; em = 652 nm; m/z 318), which indicates that a new product forms. When simultaneously conducting
                  fluorescence and colorimetric assays, the selectivity of this approach further improves because at pH 4.0, the color of the
                  NRGNPs does not change in the presence of negatively charged thiols, (e.g., N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine), but changes from
                  maroon to purple and lavender in the presence of neutral thiols (e.g., 3-mercapto-1,2-propanediol) and positively charged
                  thiols (e.g., cysteamine), respectively, as a result of aggregation. This feature allows the types of thiols to be determined
                  at concentrations &gt;1.0 and 0.1 ÂµM by the naked eye and by UV-vis absorption, respectively. Depending on the rate at which
                  the NRGNP color changes, reduced glutathione (slow) is readily distinguishable from oxidized glutathione (no aggregation and
                  no displacement) and from cysteine and homocysteine (fast).

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_tracer_labels_asl05">Gold colloids are well known to display strong plasmon absorption bands due to electron oscillations induced by the incident
                  light. When the colloids are in proximity, the plasmon absorption bands are often perturbed. This has enabled us recently
                  to successfully develop a glucose sensing platform based on the disassociation of dextrancoated gold colloids, cross-linked
                  with Con A, by glucose. However, a much more useful and simpler property of gold colloids, which has been ill explored with
                  regard to sensing, is their ability to efficiently scatter excitation fight. We have found that our nanogold sensing aggregates
                  are indeed efficient light scatters around the nanogold plasmon absorption band. By measuring the ratio of scattered fight
                  intensities at two different arbitrary wavelengths, 560 and 680 nm, glucose concentrations can be readily determined from
                  a few millimolar up to similar to 60 mM, using a simple white light LED and detection system. Further, by measuring the ratio
                  of the scattered intensities, this sensing approach is independent of the total sensing aggregate concentration and the excitation
                  and detection instrumentation fluctuations or drifts. This simplistic and low-cost approach to glucose sensing, coupled with
                  the sensing aggreagates' ability to scatter red light, suggests the potential use of these aggregates for use in physiological
                  transdermal glucose monitoring, either for implantable skin sensors or glucose sensing tattoos (discussed later).

                  An experimental method has been developed that begins with the detection and characterization of isolated nanoparticles in
                  the optical far field. The plasmon resonance optical spectrum of many individual nanoparticles are then correlated to their
                  size and shape using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We find that specific geometrical shapes give distinct
                  spectral responses. In addition, inducing subtle changes in the particles' morphology by heating causes a shift in the individual
                  particle spectrum and provides a simple means of tuning the spectral response to a desired optical wavelength. Improved colloidal
                  preparation methods could potentially lead to homogeneous populations of identical particle shapes and colors. These multicolor
                  colloids could be used as biological labels, surface enhanced Raman scattering substrates, or near field optical microscopy

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_triplet_state_bar05">Excited-state interactions between chlorophyll a (Chla) and gold nanoparticles have been studied. The emission intensity of
                  Chla is quenched by gold nanoparticles. The dominant process for this quenching has been attributed to the process of photoinduced
                  electron transfer from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, although because of a small overlap between fluorescence of Chla
                  and absorption of gold nanoparticles, the energy-transfer process cannot be ruled out. Photoinduced electron-transfer mechanism
                  is supported by the electrochemical modulation of fluorescence of Chla. In absence of an applied bias, Chla cast on gold film,
                  as a result of electron transfer, exhibits a very weak fluorescence. However, upon negatively charging the gold nanocore by
                  external bias, an increase in fluorescence intensity is observed. The negatively charged gold nanoparticles create a barrier
                  and suppress the electron-transfer process from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, resulting in an increase in radiative
                  process. Nanosecond laser flash experiments of Chla in the presence of gold nanoparticles and fullerene (C-60) have demonstrated
                  that Au nanoparticles, besides accepting electrons, can also mediate or shuttle electrons to another acceptor. Taking advantage
                  of these properties of gold nanoparticles, a photoelectrochemical cell based on Chla and gold nanoparticles is constructed.
                  A superior performance of this cell compared to that without the gold film is due to the beneficial role of gold nanoparticles
                  in accepting and shuttling the photogenerated electrons in Chla to the collecting electrode, leading to an enhancement in
                  charge separation efficiency.

                  id="abstract_ultrasensitive_chemical_analysis_alv05">In this work, the role of nanoparticle surface charge in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is examined for the common
                  case of measurements made in colloidal solutions of Ag and Au. Average SERS intensities obtained for several analytes (salicylic
                  acid, pyridine, and 2-naphthalenethiol) on Ag and An colloids are correlated with the pH and zeta potential (xi) values of
                  the nanoparticle solutions from which they were recorded. The consequence of the electrostatic interaction between the analyte
                  and the metallic nanoparticle is stressed. The xi potentials of three commonly used colloidal solutions are reported as a
                  function of pH, and a discussion is given on how these influence SERS intensity. Also examined is the importance of nanoparticle
                  aggregation (and colloidal solution collapse) in determining SERS intensities, and how this varies with the pH of the solution.
                  The results show that SERS enhancement is highest at xi potential values where the colloidal nanoparticle solutions are most
                  stable and where the electrostatic repulsion between the particles and the analyte molecules is minimized. These results suggest
                  some important criteria for consideration in all SERS measurements and also provide important insights into the problem of
                  predicting SERS activities for different molecular systems.

                  id="abstract_ultrasensitive_chemical_analysis_gou05">In this paper, the fabrication, characterization, and application of unique layer-by-layer (LBL) films of dendrimers and metallic
                  nanoparticles is reported. Silver nanoparticles (d = Â 20 nm) are produced in solution by sodium citrate reduction and incorporated
                  into thin films with generation 1 and 5 DAB-Am dendrimers (polypropylenimine dendrimers with amino surface groups) by the
                  LBL technique. The resulting nanocomposite films are characterized by UV-visible surface plasmon absorption and atomic force
                  microscopy (AFM) measurements, and employed as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of 2-naphthalenethiol.
                  Through variation of the molecular size (dendrimer generation) and concentration of the cross-linker used, as well as the
                  number of layers produced, the optical properties of several different possible architectures are studied. In the films, Ag
                  nanoparticles are shown to be effectively immobilized and stabilized with increased control over their spacing and aggregation.
                  Moreover, the films are shown to be excellent substrates for SERS measurements, demonstrating significant enhancement capability.
                  As expected, large electromagnetic enhancement of Raman scattering signals is found to be strongly dependent on interparticle
                  coupling between neighboring metallic nanoparticles. Finally, the possibility of detecting SERS signals from architectures
                  with intervening layers between the metal nanoparticles and analyte molecules is explored. It is shown that although there
                  are decreases in intensity with increasing number of intervening layers (as is expected from the distance dependence of SERS),
                  electromagnetic enhancement is still able to function at these distances, thus offering the possibility of developing sensors
                  with external layers that are chemically selective for specific analytes.

                  id="abstract_ultrathin_layers_with_a_nonlocal_dielectric_function_mor05">Fast and numerically stable transfer-matrix solution is presented for the classical electromagnetics problem of a dipole radiating
                  inside and outside a stratified sphere consisting of concentric spherical shells. There is no limitation on the dipole position,
                  the number of the concentric shells, the shell medium, or on the sphere radius. Electromagnetic fields are determined anywhere
                  in the space, the time-averaged angular distribution of the radiated power, the total radiated power, Ohmic losses due to
                  an absorbing shell, and Green?s function are calculated. An absorbing, optically active, and ultrathin (less, approximate10
                  nm) metallic shell (core), characterized by a nonlocal dielectric function, are all allowed. The classical results are then
                  applied to inelastic light scattering (fluorescence and Raman), the radiative and nonradiative normalized decay rates, and
                  frequency shift. Using correspondence principle, the radiative decay rate is calculated from the Poynting vector, whereas
                  the nonradiative decay rate is calculated from the Ohmic losses inside a sphere absorptive shell. Numerical stability of our
                  method and limitations of classical description of decay rates are addressed. The importance of grouping various radiative
                  and nonradiative decay mechanisms into local and nonlocal decay rates is emphasized. Further possible extensions of the theory
                  presented here to the case of an arbitrary multilayered (axially symmetric) particle and to the classical problem of a radiating
                  quadrupole in the presence of a multilayered particle are briefly outlined. Various applications for chemical speciation,
                  LIDAR, fluorescent microscopy, engineering of decay rates, identification of biological particles, and monitoring specific
                  cell functions are envisaged. Computer program is freely available at http://www.wave-scattering.com.

                  investigated. The electronic transitions of both dyes showed solvatochromic shifts due to specific interactions of the ligands
                  with the solvent molecules. The surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectra of the dyes dissolved in water, ethanol, and acetonitrile
                  were measured in silver and gold colloidal solutions. The results demonstrate that the dyes were adsorbed on the metallic
                  nanoparticles in different ways for different solvents. It was also found that in the gold colloid, the aqueous solutions
                  of both dyes did not produce any SERS signal, whereas in ethanolic solution the SERS effect was very weak. Deprotonation,
                  H-bonding, and donor-acceptor interactions seem to determine these different behaviors. Our results indicate the important
                  role of the charge-transfer mechanism in SERS.

                  2.5-3 ns. A third state of TMRh-DNA does not fluoresce (a dark species of TMRh-DNA). The distribution of the TMRh-DNA molecules
                  among these three slates is strongly temperature and ionic strength dependent. Estimates are made of some reaction parameters
                  of the multistate model. The results are discussed in terms of the photophysics of TMRh, and consequences of the multiple
                  conformers of TMRh-DNA for studies involving fluorescence studies with TMRh-labeled DNA are considered.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_visible_absorption_bar05">Excited-state interactions between chlorophyll a (Chla) and gold nanoparticles have been studied. The emission intensity of
                  Chla is quenched by gold nanoparticles. The dominant process for this quenching has been attributed to the process of photoinduced
                  electron transfer from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, although because of a small overlap between fluorescence of Chla
                  and absorption of gold nanoparticles, the energy-transfer process cannot be ruled out. Photoinduced electron-transfer mechanism
                  is supported by the electrochemical modulation of fluorescence of Chla. In absence of an applied bias, Chla cast on gold film,
                  as a result of electron transfer, exhibits a very weak fluorescence. However, upon negatively charging the gold nanocore by
                  external bias, an increase in fluorescence intensity is observed. The negatively charged gold nanoparticles create a barrier
                  and suppress the electron-transfer process from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, resulting in an increase in radiative
                  process. Nanosecond laser flash experiments of Chla in the presence of gold nanoparticles and fullerene (C-60) have demonstrated
                  that Au nanoparticles, besides accepting electrons, can also mediate or shuttle electrons to another acceptor. Taking advantage
                  of these properties of gold nanoparticles, a photoelectrochemical cell based on Chla and gold nanoparticles is constructed.
                  A superior performance of this cell compared to that without the gold film is due to the beneficial role of gold nanoparticles
                  in accepting and shuttling the photogenerated electrons in Chla to the collecting electrode, leading to an enhancement in
                  charge separation efficiency.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_visible_spectra_moc02">We present a systematic study of the effect of size and shape on the spectral response of individual silver nanoparticles.
                  An experimental method has been developed that begins with the detection and characterization of isolated nanoparticles in
                  the optical far field. The plasmon resonance optical spectrum of many individual nanoparticles are then correlated to their
                  size and shape using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We find that specific geometrical shapes give distinct
                  spectral responses. In addition, inducing subtle changes in the particles' morphology by heating causes a shift in the individual
                  particle spectrum and provides a simple means of tuning the spectral response to a desired optical wavelength. Improved colloidal
                  preparation methods could potentially lead to homogeneous populations of identical particle shapes and colors. These multicolor
                  colloids could be used as biological labels, surface enhanced Raman scattering substrates, or near field optical microscopy
                  sources covering the full range of wavelengths in the visible spectrum.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_ahe91">Surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectroscopy has been used to assess protein-metal interactions in colloidal immunoprobes. The
                  absence of a detectable signal from conjugates of colloidal gold with antirabbit IgG, albumin-biotin, or protein A suggests
                  that the proteins are not chemisorbed on the metal particles. Similarly, albumin, albumin-biotin, and protein A are not covalently
                  bound to colloidal silver, but rather adsorb on silver initially with the protein hydration shell intact. Over a period of
                  days, new SER bands appear in the albumin spectrum that are attributed to vibrations of aromatic amino acids. This implies
                  that conformational changes are occurring in the protein near the interface. The time scale for these changes is consistent
                  with what has been observed by circular dichroism and UV-visible spectroscopy. The effect of avidin on the binding of biotin
                  to colloidal metal probes has also been characterized. The SERS results indicate that biotin binds to a cleft or pocketlike
                  structure in avidin, restricting biotin-surface interactions. This study demonstrates the utility of SER spectroscopy for
                  characterizing protein-metal interactions and the availability of adsorbed biomolecules for complexation.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_ali96">Patterning matter on the nanometre scale is an important objective of current materials chemistry and physics. It is driven
                  by both the need to further miniaturize electronic components and the fact that at the nanometre scale, materials properties
                  are strongly size-dependent and thus can be tuned sensitively1. In nanoscale crystals, quantum size effects and the large
                  number of surface atoms influence the, chemical, electronic, magnetic and optical behaviour2?4. 'Top-down' (for example, lithographic)
                  methods for nanoscale manipulation reach only to the upper end of the nanometre regime5; but whereas 'bottom-up' wet chemical
                  techniques allow for the preparation of mono-disperse, defect-free crystallites just 1?10 nm in size6?10, ways to control
                  the structure of nanocrystal assemblies are scarce. Here we describe a strategy for the synthesis of'nanocrystal molecules',
                  in which discrete numbers of gold nanocrystals are organized into spatially defined structures based on Watson-Crick base-pairing
                  interactions. We attach single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides of defined length and sequence to individual nanocrystals, and
                  these assemble into dimers and trimers on addition of a complementary single-stranded DNA template. We anticipate that this
                  approach should allow the construction of more complex two-and three-dimensional assemblies.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_and00">By studying the transfer of excitation energy between dye molecules confined within an optical microcavity, we demonstrate
                  experimentally that FÃ¶rster energy transfer is influenced by the local photonic mode density. Locating donor and acceptor
                  molecules at well-defined positions allows the transfer rate to be determined as a function of both mutual separation and
                  cavity length. The results show that the FÃ¶rster transfer rate depends linearly on the donor emission rate and hence photonic
                  mode density, providing the potential to control energy transfer by modification of the optical environment.

                  surface profile can be included in a simple manner. These corrections enter as two lengths, which are measures of the non-locality
                  range. As an example we study the interaction between a dipole and the metal sphere, in the context of image field enhancement
                  and damping because of electron -hole pair excitations in the particle.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_ape84">The non-local response of an irradiated metal surface is discussed in terms of the induced density in response to an external
                  field. The field and the induced charge near the surface can be determined by solving Maxwell's equations in the surface region
                  and match the solution to the incoming and reflected wave in vacuum and to the asymptotic solution in the bulk of the solid.
                  For incoming fields of wave lengths long in comparison with the extension of the surface region a key quantity is the center
                  of gravity of the screening charge. This complex function of the frequency is important for a number of properties such as
                  the reflectivity, the surface plasmon dispersion, image fields, van der Waals interactions between a molecule and a metal
                  surface, etc. Considerations similar to the ones for a planar surface are also applied to the surface properties of a small
                  metallic sphere.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_ara04">For developing a magnetic bioassay system, an investigation to determine the presence of a specific biomolecular interaction
                  between biotin and streptavidin was done using magnetic nanoparticles and a silicon substrate with a self-assembled monolayer.
                  Streptavidin was immobilized on the magnetic particles, and biotin was attached to the monolayer-modified substrate. The reaction
                  of streptavidin-modified magnetic particles on the biotin-modified substrate was clearly observed under an optical microscope.
                  The magnetic signals from the particles were detected using a magnetic force microscope. The results of this study demonstrate
                  that the combination of a monolayer-modified substrate with biomolecule-modified magnetic particles is useful for detecting
                  biomolecular interactions in medical and diagnostic analyses. Â© 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_bay89">Streptavidin, an extracellular biotin-binding protein from Streptomyces avidinii, exhibits a multiplicity in its electrophoretic
                  mobility pattern which depends both upon the conditions for growth of the bacterium and upon the protocol used in the purification
                  of the protein. The observed structural heterogeneity appears to reflect the action of two types of postsecretory molecular
                  events: proteolytic digestion of the intact Mr-18,000 subunit to a minimal molecular size (approx. Mr 14,000), and aggregation
                  of the native tetramer into higher-order oligomeric forms. The extent of subunit degradation and/or tetrameric aggregation
                  affects the capacity of a given streptavidin preparation to interact with biotin-conjugated proteins in different assay systems.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_bek07">We observe an enhancement of fluorescence from a single fluorescent sphere, which is sandwiched between two individual gold
                  nanoparticles, forming a hot spot of strong field enhancement. The fluorescence enhancing hot spot is custom-designed by the
                  deliberate assembly of gold nanoparticles with an atomic force microscope cantilever. The fluorescence intensity is monitored
                  while the separation between the two gold nanoparticles is reduced by gradually pushing the gold nanoparticles closer to the
                  fluorescent sphere. The fluorescence enhancement is maximal when the distance between the two gold nanoparticles is smallest,
                  when the excitation polarization is parallel to the axis of the sandwich, and when the fluorescent sphere is positioned exactly
                  on the axis connecting the two gold nanoparticles.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_ber05">The photothermal heterodyne imaging method is used to study for the first time the absorption spectra of individual gold nanoparticles
                  with diameters down to 5 nm. Intrinsic size effects that result in a broadening of the surface plasmon resonance are unambiguously
                  observed. Dispersions in the peak energies and homogeneous widths of the single-particle resonances are revealed. The experimental
                  results are analyzed within the frame of Mie theory.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_big00">A novel photoluminescence is reported for small metal nanocrystals in the near-infrared region (1.1-1.6 m). Near-infrared
                  photoluminescence spectra were measured at room temperature for 1.1 and 1.7 nm Au nanocrystals using a 1.06 m excitation source.
                  This photoluminescence is attributed to sp to sp-like transitions, analogous to intraband transitions in bulk gold; however,
                  the exact mechanism is unknown. A conservative estimate for the quantum yield for the 1.7 nm gold nanocrystals is (4.4 Â± 1.5)
                  Ã 10-5 at room temperature, more than 5 orders of magnitude greater than that of bulk gold.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_blo02">Summary Optical far-field imaging of single molecules in a frozen solution at 1.2 K with a lateral resolution of 3.4 nm is
                  reported. The mechanical stability of the fluorescence microscope, especially of the low-temperature insert, allows for the
                  localization of fluorescing molecules with a reproducibility of better than 5 nm within observation times up to 10 min. For
                  observation times of 9 h the reproducibility of the lateral position is limited to about 20 nm due to mechanical drift. Lateral
                  position and orientation of 314 single molecules, present within the confocal detection volume of Â 10 um3, are obtained. The
                  possibility to correct for mechanical drift by monitoring the position of a spatial reference in the sample is demonstrated.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_bos02">Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) from Rhodamine 6G adsorbed on small, optically resolvable aggregates of silver nanoparticles
                  is detectable at the single-molecule level. The signal fluctuates on a second time scale, presumably due to movement of the
                  molecule in to and out of the SERS active "hot spots". The depolarization of the signal is found to be independent of the
                  fluctuations, to vary from one spot to the next, and to be highly dependent on the direction of the incident electric field.
                  The "SERS continuum" dominates the signal and is assumed to arise from electronic Raman processes in the metal that are triggered
                  by chemisorption of the molecule in the hot spot. The source of the Raman signal is therefore highly localized around the
                  hot spot. The local structure determines the depolarization properties and is often extremely anisotropic. Conversely, the
                  Rayleigh scattering does not depend on the molecule or the hot spot and is delocalized over the whole aggregate, which is
                  always found to be highly isotropic. The Rayleigh scattering therefore does not fluctuate and is always highly polarized.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_bus03">The spectroscopic characteristics (absorption, emission, and fluorescence lifetime) of 13 commercially available red-absorbing
                  fluorescent dyes were studied under a variety of conditions. The dyes included in this study are Alexa647, ATTO655, ATTO680,
                  Bodipy630/650, Cy5, Cy5.5, DiD, DY-630, DY-635, DY-640, DY-650, DY-655, and EVOblue30. The thorough characterization of this
                  class of dyes will facilitate selection of the appropriate red-absorbing fluorescent labels for applications in fluorescence
                  assays. The influences of polarity, viscosity, and the addition of detergent (Tween20) on the spectroscopic properties were
                  investigated, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) was utilized to assess the photophysical properties of the dyes
                  under high excitation conditions. The dyes can be classified into groups based on the results presented. For example, while
                  the fluorescence quantum yield of ATTO655, ATTO680, and EVOblue30 is primarily controlled by the polarity of the surrounding
                  medium, more hydrophobic and structurally flexible dyes of the DY-family are strongly influenced by the viscosity of the medium
                  and the addition of detergents. Covalent binding of the dyes to biotin and subsequent addition of streptavidin results in
                  reversible fluorescence quenching or changes in the relaxation time of other photophysical processes of some dyes, most likely
                  due to interactions with tryptophan residues in the streptavin binding site.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_cam06">Colloidal gold nanoparticles were conjugated with oligonucleotides to create biorecognition nanomodules. The efficiency of
                  conjugation was determined by fluorescence using a FITC-labelled thiolated model probe and by enzyme-linked nanoparticle assay
                  (ELINA) using a digoxigeninlabelled thiolated model probe. The thermal stability of the conjugation was determined by displacement
                  and fluorescence measurement of the FITC probe. Functionality for hybridisation was determined by enzyme-linked oligonucleotide
                  assay (ELONA). It was found that the equilibrium oligonucleotide surface coverage reached 37% of the total nanoparticle area.
                  These results could be verified by ELINA. Under hybridisation conditions that allowed the detection of 4-point mutations on
                  a target 19-rner sequence (1 h at 65 C), it was found that the bio functionalised nanomodules lost between 10 and 30% of the
                  conjugated biorecognition molecules.

                  and Raman-active dyes. The gold nanoparticles facilitate the formation of a silver coating that acts as a surface-enhanced
                  Raman scattering promoter for the dye-labeled particles that have been captured by target molecules and an underlying chip
                  in microarray format. The strategy provides the high-sensitivity and high-selectivity attributes of gray-scale scanometric
                  detection but adds multiplexing and ratioing capabilities because a very large number of probes can be designed based on the
                  concept of using a Raman tag as a narrow-band spectroscopic fingerprint. Six dissimilar DNA targets with six Raman-labeled

                  physical, and chemical methods. Streptavidin binds four molecules of biotin. Chemical analysis shows the absence of hexoses
                  and amino sugars associated with avidin and reveals differences in amino acid content. Electrophoretic studies give different
                  mobilities for streptavidin and avidin. Thus, streptavidin is a new type of biotin-binding protein.

                  that have a LSPR scattering peak Â 40-120 meV higher in energy than the emission peak of the fluorophore. These results should

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_chi95">We report the functional characterization of site-directed biotin binding-site mutants of recombinant core streptavidin. The
                  mutagenesis studies were aimed at characterizing the contributions of Trp residues known to contact biotin that have been
                  postulated to control the exceptional binding affinity observed in this system. The functional properties of single site-directed
                  mutants replacing Trp residues with Phe or Ala at positions 79, 108, and 120 were investigated by quantitating the EC50 binding
                  parameters of these mutants to biotin and 2-iminobiotin in an ELISA format. The biotin EC50 for all mutants was the same as
                  wild-type streptavidin, demonstrating that their DeltaKa values relative to wild type were &lt;106. The conservative W79F and
                  W108F mutants displayed only a 2- to 3-fold increase in EC50 for 2-iminobiotin, corresponding to an estimated DeltaKa &lt;10,
                  while the W120F mutant displayed a much greater alteration in 2-iminobiotin EC50, corresponding to an estimated DeltaKa of
                  102. These DeltaKa values are likely to reflect similar changes for biotin. The 2-iminobiotin EC50 values for the Ala mutants
                  fell outside the accessible concentration range of the ELISA assay, demonstrating that these mutations lowered the Ka by a
                  factor of 104 to 106. Direct estimation of biotin Ka values for W79A, W120A, and W120F in an ultrafiltration binding assay
                  yielded Ka values of 4.3 x 107 M-1, 8.6 x 106 M-1, and &gt;5 x 109 M-1, respectively, in excellent agreement with the ELISA estimates
                  of DeltaKa with 2-iminobiotin as a reporter ligand. The results of these preliminary functional studies suggest that these
                  aromatic side chains contribute significantly to the streptavidin-biotin binding free energy.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_cit05">While the conceptual framework for nanoplasmonic waveguides composed of a chain of noncontacting metal nanoparticles usually
                  neglects the effects of the ends, the long-range nature of the interparticle coupling underlying the electromagnetic transport
                  means that finite chain length can play an important role. Here, the complex energies of the plasmon-polariton modes in finite-length
                  nanoparticle chains are calculated to ascertain the effects of chain length on the mode dispersion and the radiative contribution
                  to the attenuation. The results indicate that, for typical parameters, the infinite-chain limit is reached with Â 10 nanoparticles.
                  Thus, even for chain lengths well exceeding the attenuation length, long-range coupling of distant nanoparticles is shown
                  to impact the dispersion and radiative loss.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_cor02">A model for the calculation of excitation energies of molecules close to a metal surface is presented. The molecule is treated
                  at the density functional theory (DFT) or Hartree-Fock (HF) level and the excitation energies are calculated through a time
                  dependent DFT (TDDFT) or time dependent HF (TDHF) procedure. The metal is treated as a continuous body characterized by its
                  frequency dependent dielectric constant, taken from experiments, in the case modified to take into account nonlocal effects
                  in the response to the metal. Such effects are accounted for by using the specular reflection model and a hydrodynamic correction
                  to the dielectric constant. The presence of a solvent is described with the Polarizable Continuum Model. The (quasi-)electrostatic
                  interactions between the molecule and the metal-solvent environment are treated by exploiting the integral equation formalism,
                  numerically solved through a boundary element method. Applications of the method are given to show its numerical accuracy
                  and the dependence of the results on the various parameters of the model (e.g., nature of the molecule, solvent, chemical
                  nature of the metal, metal-molecule distance).

                  with excited-state relaxation in tris-(2,2'-bipyridine)ruthenium(II). The data reveal dynamics associated with the temporal
                  evolution of the Franck-Condon state to the lowest energy excited state of this molecule. The process is essentially complete
                  in sim 300 femtoseconds after the initial excitation. This result is discussed with regard to reformulating long-held notions
                  about excited-state relaxation, as well as its implication for the importance of non-equilibrium excited-state processes in
                  understanding and designing molecular-based electron transfer, artificial photosynthetic, and photovoltaic assemblies in which

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_dev07">We developed a technique for the local electrical detection of a plasmon resonance in a single metal nanoparticle. A gold
                  nanoparticle is coupled to a GaAs photodetector placed in the particle's near field. Light scattered by the particle is coupled
                  into the semiconductor cavity of the photodetector, providing efficient transduction. Strong multipolar resonances were recorded
                  in the 650-920 nm wavelength range. This local detection technique allows the construction of sensitive nanoscale bioprobes
                  and arrays thereof.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_dex53">The term ``sensitized luminescence'' in crystalline phosphors refers to the phenomenon whereby an impurity (activator, or
                  emitter) is enabled to luminesce upon the absorption of light in a different type of center (sensitizer, or absorber) and
                  upon the subsequent radiationless transfer of energy from the sensitizer to the activator. The resonance theory of FÃ¶rster,
                  which involves only allowed transitions, is extended to include transfer by means of forbidden transitions which, it is concluded,
                  are responsible for the transfer in all inorganic systems yet investigated. The transfer mechanisms of importance are, in
                  order of decreasing strength, the overlapping of the electric dipole fields of the sensitizer and the activator, the overlapping
                  of the dipole field of the sensitizer with the quadrupole field of the activator, and exchange effects. These mechanisms will
                  give rise to ``sensitization'' of about 10^3-10^4, 10^2, and 30 lattice sites surrounding each sensitizer in typical systems.
                  The dependence of transfer efficiency upon sensitizer and activator concentrations and on temperature are discussed. Application
                  is made of the theory to experimental results on inorganic phosphors, and further experiments are suggested.

                  using infrared-ultraviolet (IR-UV) hole-filling and IR-induced population transfer spectroscopies. IR radiation selectively
                  excites individual NH stretch vibrational fundamentals of single conformations of the molecule in the early portions of a
                  gas-phase expansion, and then this excited population is collisionally recooled into its conformational minima for subsequent
                  conformation-specific detection. Efficient isomerization is induced by the IR excitation that redistributes population between
                  the same conformations that have population in the absence of IR excitation. The quantum yields for transfer of the population
                  into the various conformational minima depend uniquely on which conformation is excited and on which NH stretch vibration
                  is excited within a given conformation.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_doe02">Recent research in several groups has identified a new class of metal colloidal nanoparticles that is able to enhance the
                  efficiencies of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) by as much as 1014-1015 fold. This enormous enhancement allows single-molecule
                  detection and spectroscopy at room temperature. Previous single-molecule and single-particle studies have yielded important
                  insights into the mechanism of electromagnetic field enhancement, but little is known about the contributions of surface active
                  sites and chemical enhancement. Here we report a direct examination of chemical enhancement by using an integrated flow injection
                  and ultrasensitive optical imaging/spectroscopy system. A key feature is that colloidal silver nanoparticles are immobilized
                  on a glass surface inside a microflow device and that single-particle SERS signals are observed in real time while the immobilized
                  particles are treated by chemical reagents in the flow cell. In situ surface plasmon scattering studies of spatially isolated
                  particles indicate that their electromagnetic properties do not change after chemical treatment. Thus, the observed SERS spectral
                  changes should primarily come from chemical enhancement at surface active sites. Our experimental data reveal that three halide
                  ions (Cl-, Br-, and I-) have a substantial activating effect, whereas other ions such as citrate, sulfate, and fluoride have
                  little or no effect on single-particle SERS. A "quenching" effect is observed for thiosulfate ions, which completely destroys
                  the SERS activity. The chemical enhancement factors are estimated to be about 102-103 for rhodamine 6G molecules adsorbed
                  on single Ag nanoparticles

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_dra05">Antibody-antigen binding events at a monolayer protein concentration have been demonstrated on nanostructured adaptive silver
                  films (ASFs) using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and luminescence-based assays. It is shown that proteins stabilize
                  and restructure the ASF to increase the SERS signal while preserving antigen-binding activity. Evidence for antibody-antigen
                  binding on the ASF substrates is the distinct SERS spectral changes of the surface-bound antibody or antigen without special
                  tags. The activity of the surface-bound proteins and their practical application are validated by independent immunochemical
                  assays. Results are presented to demonstrate that these surfaces can be extended to protein arrays with detection applications
                  distinct from current SERS, fluorescence, or luminescence methods.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_dra88">The discrete dipole approximation (DDA), a flexible method for computing scattering of radiation by particles of arbitrary
                  shape, is extended to incorporate the effects of radiative reaction and to allow for possible anisotropy of the dielectric
                  tensor of the material. Formulas are given for the evaluation of extinction, absorption, scattering, and polarization cross
                  sections. A simple numerical algorithm based on the method of conjugate gradients is found to provide an efficient and robust
                  method for obtaining accurate solutions to the scattering problem. The method works well for absorptive, as well as dielectric,
                  grain materials. Two validity criteria for the DDA are presented. The DDA is then used to compute extinction cross sections
                  for spherical graphite grains and to calculate extinction cross sections for nonspherical graphite grains with three different
                  geometries. It is concluded that the interstellar 2175 A extinction feature could be produced by small graphite grains which
                  should have aspect ratios not far from unity.

                  hybrid molecule increases by a factor of as much as several thousand as it binds to a complementary ssDNA. We show that this
                  composite molecule is a different type of molecular beacon with a sensitivity enhanced up to 100-fold. In competitive hybridization
                  assays, the ability to detect single mismatch is eightfold greater with this probe than with other molecular beacons.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_edm96">Phenomena that can be observed for a large number of molecules may not be understood if it is not possible to observe the
                  events on the single-molecule level. We measured the fluorescence lifetimes of individual tetramethylrhodamine molecules,
                  linked to an 18-mer deoxyribonucleotide sequence specific for M13 DNA, by time-resolved, single-photon counting in a confocal
                  fluorescence microscope during Brownian motion in solution. When many molecules were observed, a biexponential fluorescence
                  decay was observed with equal amplitudes. However, on the single-molecule level, the fraction of one of the amplitudes spanned
                  from 0 to unity for a collection of single-molecule detections. Further analysis by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy
                  made on many molecules revealed a process that obeys a stretched exponential relaxation law. These facts, combined with previous
                  evidence of the quenching effect of guanosine on rhodamines, indicate that the tetramethylrhodamine molecule senses conformational
                  transitions as it associates and dissociates to a guanosine-rich area. Thus, our results reveal conformational transitions
                  in a single molecule in solution under conditions that are relevant for biological processes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_egg98b">A recently developed, real-time spectroscopic technique, burst-integrated fluorescence lifetime (BIFL), is shown to be well
                  suited for monitoring the individual molecular conformational dynamics of a single molecule diffusing through the microscopic,
                  open measurement volume (10 fl) of a confocal epi-illuminated set-up. In a highly diluted aqueous solution of 20-mer oligonucleotide
                  strand of DNA duplex labeled with the environment-sensitive fluorescent dye tetramethylrhodamine (TMR), fluorescence bursts
                  indicating traces of individual molecules are registered and further subjected to selective burst analysis. The two-dimensional

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_ekg04">The highly sensitive nature of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy and surface plasmon field-enhanced fluorescence
                  spectroscopy (SPFS) are governed by the strong surface plasmon resonance-generated evanescent field at the metal/dielectric
                  interface. The greatest evanescent field amplitude at the interface and the maximum attenuation of the reflectance are observed
                  when a nonabsorbing dielectric is employed. An absorbing dielectric decreases the evanescent field enhancement at the interface.
                  The SPR curve of an absorbing dielectric is characterized by a greater reflectance minimum and a broader curve, as compared
                  to those of the nonabsorbing dielectric with the same refractive index. For a weakly absorbing dielectric, such as nanometer-thick
                  surface-confined fluorophores, the absorption is too small to induce a significant change in the SPR curve. However, the presence
                  of a minute amount of the fluorophore can be detected by the highly sensitive SPFS. The angle with the maximum fluorescence
                  intensity of an SPFS curve is always smaller than the resonance angle of the corresponding SPR curve. This discrepancy is
                  due to the differences of evanescent field distributions and their decay characteristics within the metal film and the dielectric
                  medium. The fluorescence intensity in an SPFS curve can be expressed in terms of the evanescent field amplitude. Excellent
                  correlations between the experimentally measured fluorescence intensities and the evanescent field amplitudes are observed.

                  Hybridization was facilitated by freezing and thawing of the solutions, and the denaturation of these hybrid materials showed
                  transition temperatures over a narrow range that allowed differentiation of a variety of imperfect targets. Transfer of the

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_fag96">FT Raman spectra of avidin, streptavidin, and of the two anhydrous biotin complexes were obtained by excitation in near infrared
                  (NIR). As far as avidin and the avidin-biotin complex are concerned, the excitation in NIR did not change the main features
                  of the spectra compared with those previously obtained by visible excitation. However, the intensity of Trp bands did not
                  change due to the formation of the complex when excited by NIR excitation, whereas an intensity increase was observed by 514
                  nm excitation. The percentages of secondary structure of the two proteins and the biotin complexes were obtained from the
                  Raman spectra. The vibrational results indicate that as a consequence of the interaction with biotin, the percentages of &amp;bgr;-sheet
                  conformation of the proteins decrease whereas the percentages of &amp;agr;-helix conformation increase. The observed changes of
                  the conformation of streptavidin induced by biotin interaction are comparable with those obtained with avidin; this fact confirms
                  that the type of the binding should be similar for the two molecules. Moreover, as a result of the biotin binding, the hydrophobicity
                  of the environment of the Trp residues of streptavidin slightly increases according to the increase in intensity of the 1360
                  cm-1 component. This result could suggest that the streptavidin-biotin complex is stabilized mainly by hydrophobic interactions.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_fao90">Gracilaria is a group of warm water seaweeds. There are more than one hundred species in the world, some of which have very
                  important economic value. Gracilaria is used as food and in the preparation of food products. It is also an important raw
                  material in agar-agar production. At present, the world's annual output of Gracilaria is about 30,000 tons, dry weight, most
                  of which comes from natural production. For example, the natural production in Chile, Argentina, and Brazil accounts for one
                  third of this total output. With the increasing demand for Gracilaria, greater attention has been focused on the development
                  of its artificial culture by many countries, especially those in Southeast Asia. China is the earliest country that artificially
                  cultured Gracilaria. Today, the culture area in South China is about 2,000 ha producing 3,000 tons dried material annually.
                  Taiwan produces 1,000 tons dried Gracilaria yearly from 400 hectares under cultivation. Nowadays, Gracilaria is cultured mainly
                  using the following methods: bottom culture, raft culture, stake-rope culture and pond culture. Pond culture can be divided
                  into two systems, monoculture and polyculture with shrimp and other species. The varieties of culture methods can be adapted
                  for different areas. In view of the importance of Gracilaria as a seafarming commodity, the National Coordinators of the Regional
                  Seafarming Project recommended the dissemination of its culture and processing technology, through a regional training and
                  demonstration activity, as a means to further increase the opportunities to develop the seafarming industry of the region.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_fer01">There is a striking disparity between the heart-shaped structure of human serum albumin (HSA) observed in single crystals
                  and the elongated ellipsoid model used for decades to interpret the protein solution hydrodynamics at neutral pH. These two
                  contrasting views could be reconciled if the protein were flexible enough to change its conformation in solution from that
                  found in the crystal. To investigate this possibility we recorded the rotational motions in real time of an erythrosin-bovine
                  serum albumin complex (Er-BSA) over an extended time range, using phosphorescence depolarization techniques. These measurements
                  are consistent with the absence of independent motions of large protein segments in solution, in the time range from nanoseconds
                  to fractions of milliseconds, and give a single rotational correlation time [phi](BSA, 1 cP, 20degreesC) = 40 +/- 2 ns. In
                  addition, we report a detailed analysis of the protein hydrodynamics based on two bead-modeling methods. In the first, BSA
                  was modeled as a triangular prismatic shell with optimized dimensions of 84 x 84 x 84 x 31.5 A, whereas in the second, the
                  atomic-level structure of HSA obtained from crystallographic data was used to build a much more refined rough-shell model.
                  In both cases, the predicted and experimental rotational diffusion rate and other hydrodynamic parameters were in good agreement.
                  Therefore, the overall conformation in neutral solution of BSA, as of HSA, should be rigid, in the sense indicated above,
                  and very similar to the heart-shaped structure observed in HSA crystals.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_fis04">We present measurements of photoluminescence decay dynamics from single colloidal CdSe quantum dots. We find that the decays
                  fluctuate in time with decay rates that correlate with time-averaged emission intensities. Moreover, the decays measured by
                  selecting only those photons collected while the single quantum dot emission intensity was near its maximum yields single-exponential
                  dynamics. We find that the "maximum-intensity" decays are nearly identical across different independently synthesized samples
                  of nearly the same size. The combination of single-exponential kinetics and decays that are reproducible across samples leads
                  us to speculate that it is the radiative lifetime that is measured and that the quantum yield of a single dot near its maximum
                  emission intensity is close to unity. The variations in decay rates with time and their correlation with emission intensity
                  indicate these intensity time trajectories primarily reflect fluctuations in nonradiative relaxation pathways.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_fra02">Despite the well-known relationship between the resonance Raman excitation profile and the absorption line shape, there is
                  scant experimental evidence for effects in absorption or fluorescence spectroscopy related to the observations of surface-enhanced
                  Raman scattering (SERS). On the other hand, numerous Raman studies have been done on the SERS phenomenon, where large enhancement
                  factors have been determined. In this work, the absorption properties of molecules adsorbed on single gold and silver nanoparticles
                  (monomers) have been investigated, with particular emphasis on an examination of the effect on the spectrum of the adsorbate.
                  A number of the adsorbates studied are similar to those reported in SERS studies. The adsorbates can be divided into two classes
                  according to the nature of the interaction with the adsorbent. Class I shows little change in the absorption spectrum. Class
                  II shows a large reduction in absorption. The only examples of an increase in absorption arise from solvatochromic effects.
                  The implication of these observations for the mechanism of SERS is discussed.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_fre97">The streptavidin-biotin complex provides the basis for many important biotechnological applications and is an interesting
                  model system for studying high-affinity protein-ligand interactions. We report here crystallographic studies elucidating the
                  conformation of the flexible binding loop of streptavidin (residues 45 to 52) in the unbound and bound forms. The crystal
                  structures of unbound streptavidin have been determined in two monoclinic crystal forms. The binding loop generally adopts
                  an open conformation in the unbound species. In one subunit of one crystal form, the flexible loop adopts the closed conformation
                  and an analysis of packing interactions suggests that protein-protein contacts stabilize the closed loop conformation. In
                  the other crystal form all loops adopt an open conformation. Co-crystallization of streptavidin and biotin resulted in two
                  additional, different crystal forms, with ligand bound in all four binding sites of the first crystal form and biotin bound
                  in only two subunits in a second. The major change associated with binding of biotin is the closure of the surface loop incorporating
                  residues 45 to 52. Residues 49 to 52 display a 3(10) helical conformation in unbound subunits of our structures as opposed
                  to the disordered loops observed in other structure determinations of streptavidin. In addition, the open conformation is
                  stabilized by a beta-sheet hydrogen bond between residues 45 and 52, which cannot occur in the closed conformation. The 3(10)
                  helix is observed in nearly all unbound subunits of both the co-crystallized and ligand-free structures. An analysis of the
                  temperature factors of the binding loop regions suggests that the mobility of the closed loops in the complexed structures
                  is lower than in the open loops of the ligand-free structures. The two biotin bound subunits in the tetramer found in the
                  MONO b1 crystal form are those that contribute Trp 120 across their respective binding pockets, suggesting a structural link
                  between these binding sites in the tetramer. However, there are no obvious signatures of binding site communication observed
                  upon ligand binding, such as quaternary structure changes or shifts in the region of Trp 120. These studies demonstrate that
                  while crystallographic packing interactions can stabilize both the open and closed forms of the flexible loop, in their absence
                  the loop is open in the unbound state and closed in the presence of biotin. If present in solution, the helical structure
                  in the open loop conformation could moderate the entropic penalty associated with biotin binding by contributing an order-to-disorder
                  component to the loop closure.

                  generated via DNA hybridization and purified by gel electrophoresis. Statistics from TEM analysis showed a high yield of designed
                  structures. The distance between Au particles and QD, the number of Au around the central QD, and the size of Au and QD can
                  be adjusted. Rationally designed structures such as these hold great promise for researching the physical interactions between

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_fut04">The blinking of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signal was observed for Ag touching particles with an extremely small
                  number of molecules progressively extinguished in 10-30 min probably because of thermal diffusion to marginal sites from the
                  junction or complete desorption of adsorbates. Interestingly, we found a significant change in elastic scattering spectra
                  observed with a white light source during the inactivation process of SERS. Furthermore, it turned out exploiting numerical
                  simulations for the local electric field and scattering spectra that such spectral changes result from the distinct electromagnetic
                  coupling between the localized surface plasmon (LSP) and absorption of dye according to the on/off features of SERS activity.
                  This is induced by thermal diffusion of individual molecules in and out of the junctions in accordance with the experimental
                  observations on the vast enhancement in SERS. Thus, the critical importance of the junctions of Ag particles was confirmed
                  concerning the origin of the blinking and mechanism of the enormous enhancement in SERS.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_fut06">An enormous SERS (Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering) signal from dye and adenine on hot or blinking silver nanoparticles is
                  extinguished by duration of measurement possibly due to thermal diffusion or desorption of adsorbed molecules. Simultaneously,
                  the elastic scattering peak at ca. 630 nm disappears. The Three-dimensional Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD-3D) method
                  manifests this scattering peak as originating from enhanced coupling of localized surface plasmon (LSP) on adjacent Ag particles
                  through absorption of adspecies located at their junction. Distinct emission peaks were observed at 550-600 nm and 600-750
                  nm. Based on the spectral variations for different surface coverage and for different dye species, the shorter and longer
                  wavelength peaks were attributed to excited electrons on metal, and from fluorescence of molecules, respectively. Furthermore,
                  we found the shorter wavelength peak shows invariant Stokes shift irrespective of excitation wavelengths, indicating it arises
                  from inelastic scattering of excited electron by surface roughness or by adsorbed molecules.

                  are solved for any arbitrary cluster geometry and for any light (polarized or not) incidence by usual expansion of the various
                  fields. Usual boundary conditions are used but take into account the possible existence of plasmons in the spheres. High-order
                  multipolar (electric and magnetic) interaction effects are included. The problem is cast into the calculation of the microscopic
                  effective dielectric and magnetic susceptibility for the spheres, and that of the appropriate interaction terms. The latter
                  (which constitute the hardest part of the theory in general) are calculated by formulating in a very practical way a recurrence
                  relation for spherical vector wave functions in different reference frames. The extinction cross section is derived for any
                  arbitrary case in order to allow for comparison of experimental data and previous theoretical work. The theory in the absence
                  of any high-order polar effect is applied to the case of metallic clusters, e.g., small sodium spheres. Effects due to size
                  distribution, sphere separation, and sphere magnetic permittivity are analyzed. Different light incidences are considered.
                  A very brief discussion of the experimental status is presented for the case of metallic spheres. New experiments are suggested
                  for which the theory is easily read out. Appendices contain new relations between Legendre functions and "spherical coupling
                  parameters" allowing one to treat up to (24,24) polar-order interactions.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_ger85">The optical response of molecucules adsorbed at or near interfaces are known to be strongly modified relative to those of
                  the free molecules. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering is the most prominent example, however practically all molecular optical
                  properties are affected. In this paper we review the electromagnetic theory of these phenomena with particular emphasis on
                  resonance processes. We discuss lifetimes of excited molecular states, absorption, resonance Raman and fluorescence cross-sections,
                  light scattering and emission yields, energy transfer between adsorbed molecules and photochemical processes. The electromagnetic
                  theory of these phenomena incorporates the surface effect on the local electromagnetic field intensity with the surface-induced
                  radiative and nonradiative decay rates to give working expressions for cross-sections, rates and yields of surface optical
                  processes in terms of the incident beam direction, polarization and frequency, geometry and optical properties of the substrate
                  and its environment and of the optical properties, location and orientation (relative to the substrate) of the adsorbed molecule.
                  Available experimental results are in good qualitative or semiquantitative agreement with the theory. In addition we consider
                  the role of cavity sites in surface-enhanced optical processes. We discuss two models for cavity sites, the conical wedge
                  and enclosures between small particles. The latter are shown to be associated with particularly large enhancements both of
                  the local field intensity and of the surface-induced radiative and nonradiative decay rates. Finally we dwell on the optical
                  properties of small molecular particles which, near the molecular resonance, may give rise to strong local field enhancement
                  provided that the molecules respond coherently to the incident radiation field. We show that the overall response depends
                  on the rate of dephasing processes, which act to drive molecules out of phase with each other. The actual enhancements depend
                  on this rate and on the particle size and shape.

                  and the rate of quenching efficiency with particle size is different for two different size regimes. The size regime dependence
                  of the particles on the fluorescence quenching process have been rationalized in view of the dependence of surface area on
                  the size of the particles. The mechanism of fluorescence quenching on the gold surfaces has been treated in the light of electron

                  We present a general method to calculate the effective dynamic polarizability of such physisorbed systems by including the
                  nonlocal character of the electron response in the sphere. Our model takes into account several long-range mechanisms connected
                  to the dispersion, induction and local field effects. When the sphere reduces to a single atom, we recover results already
                  known for a pair of atoms.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_gir96">The development of near-field optics theory is reviewed. We first recall that near-field optics is not limited to near-field
                  microscopy. Broadly speaking, it concerns phenomena involving evanescent electromagnetic waves. The importance of such waves
                  was ignored for a long time in optical and surface physics until the emergence of scanning near-field optical microscopes.
                  Taking evanescent waves into account prevents the use of any simple approximation in the set of Maxwell's equations. The various
                  theoretical approaches of near-field optics are discussed from the point of view of their ability to assess evanescent electromagnetic
                  waves. We discuss the main results of the application of the various practical schemes which all rely on a numerical procedure.
                  This review was received in February 1996.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_gol05">We report herein biotin-streptavidin-mediated aggregation studies of long gold nanorods. We have previously demonstrated end-to-end
                  linkages of gold nanorods driven by the biotin-streptavidin interaction (Caswell et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003, 125, 13914).
                  In that report, the specific binding of biotin disulfide to the gold nanorod edges was achieved due to the preferred binding
                  of thiol molecules to the Au111 surface (gold nanorod ends) as opposed to the gold nanorod side faces. This led to the end-end
                  linkage of gold nanorods upon subsequent addition of streptavidin. In this report we demonstrate a simple procedure to biotinylate
                  the entire gold nanorod surface and subsequently form a 3-D assembly by addition of streptavidin. Gold nanorods were synthesized
                  by the three-step seeding protocol documented in our previous articles. The surface of gold nanorods was further modified
                  by a layer of a weak polyelectrolyte, poly(acrylic acid), PAA. A biotin molecule which has an amine group at one end (biotin-PEO-amine)
                  was anchored to the carboxylic acid group of the polyelectrolyte using the well-known carbodiimide chemistry. This process
                  biotinylates the entire gold nanorod surface. Addition of streptavidin further leads to aggregation of gold nanorods. A closer
                  look at the aggregates reveals a preferential side-to-side assembly of gold nanorods. The gold nanorods were characterized
                  at each stage by UV-vis spectroscopy, light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_gov06">We describe the physical properties of excitons in hybrid complexes composed of semiconductor and metal nanoparticles. The
                  interaction between individual nanoparticles is revealed as an enhancement or suppression of emission. Enhanced emission comes
                  from electric field amplified by the plasmon resonance, whereas emission suppression is a result of energy transfer from semiconductor
                  to metal nanoparticles. The emission intensity and energy transfer rate depend strongly on the geometrical parameters of the
                  superstructure and the physical and material properties of the nanoparticles. In particular, the emission enhancement effect
                  appears for nanoparticles with relatively small quantum yield, and silver nanoparticles have stronger enhancement compared
                  to gold ones. Using realistic models, we review and analyze available experimental data on energy transfer between nanoparticles.
                  In hybrid superstructures conjugated with polymer linkers, optical emission is sensitive to environmental parameters such
                  as, for example, temperature. This sensitivity comes from expansion or contraction of a linker. With increasing temperature,
                  emission of polymer-conjugated complexes can decrease or increase depending on the organization of a superstructure. The structures
                  described here have potential as sensors and actuators.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_hai92">A large gold cluster (Au1.4nm) was covalently coupled to IgG and Fab' fragments. Its gold core is 1.4 nm in diameter and the
                  Fab'-Au1.4nm immunoconjugate is the smallest gold immunoprobe that can be seen directly in the conventional electron microscope.
                  It is useful in high- resolution immunolabeling, providing a resolution of 7.0 nm. The cluster's visibility can be enhanced
                  with silver development for use in EM or light microscopy for histological purposes, or to detect less than or equal to 0.2

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_hay99">We introduce a method of dye fluorescence excitation and measurement that utilizes a near-field scanning optical microscope
                  (NSOM). This NSOM uses an apertureless metallic probe, and an optical system that contains a high numerical aperture (NA)
                  objective lens (NA = 1.4). When the area which satisfies NA &lt; 1 is masked, the objective lens allows for the rejection of
                  possible transmitted light (NA &lt; 1) through the sample. In such conditions, the focused spot consists of only the evanescent
                  field. We found that this NSOM system strongly reduces the background of the dye fluorescence and allows for the measurement
                  of the fluorescence intensity below the diffraction limit of the excitation source.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_hec04">This paper reviews the recent progress in using single quantum systems, here mainly single fluorescent molecules, as local
                  probes for nano-optical field distributions. We start by discussing the role of the absorption cross-section for the spatial
                  resolution attainable in such experiments and its behaviour for different environmental conditions. It is shown that the spatial
                  distribution of field components in a high-numerical aperture laser focus can be mapped with high precision using single fluorescent
                  molecules embedded in a thin polymer film on glass. With this proof-of-principle experiment as a starting point, the possibility
                  of mapping strongly confined and enhanced nano-optical fields close to material structures, e.g. sharp metal tips, is discussed.
                  The mapping of the spatial distribution of the enhanced field at an etched gold tip using a single molecule is presented as
                  an example. Energy transfer effects and quenching are identified as possible artefacts in this context. Finally, it is demonstrated
                  that the local quenching at a sharp metal structure nevertheless can be exploited as a novel contrast mechanism for ultrahigh-resolution
                  optical microscopy with single-molecule sensitivity.

                  The partial emission rate into the resonator modes is enhanced by a factor of 19 when the resonator is tuned to the atomic
                  transition frequency and inhibited by a factor of 42 when it is detuned. This results in a fractional increase of 1.6% and
                  decrease of 0.5%, respectively, in the total spontaneous emission rate, which we verify by monitoring changes in the intensity
                  of light emitted out the sides of the resonator as it is tuned.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_hen89">A three-dimensional crystal structure of the biotin-binding core of streptavidin has been determined at 3.1- angstrom resolution.
                  The structure was analyzed from diffraction data measured at three wavelengths from a single crystal of the selenobiotinyl
                  complex with streptavidin. Streptavidin is a tetramer with subunits arrayed in D2 symmetry. Each protomer is an 8-stranded
                  beta -barrel with simple up-down topology. Biotin molecules are bound at one end of each barrel. This study demonstrates the
                  effectiveness of multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) procedures for macromolecular crystallography and provides a
                  basis for detailed study of biotinavidin interactions.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_her05">We present for the first time experimental evidence of fluorescence lifetime enhancement of organic chromophores attached
                  to metal nanospheres via radiative decay engineering. The hybrid system (HS) was a modified "diconjugated" molecular probe,
                  4-acetamido-4'-maleimidylstilbene-2,2'-dithiol (AMDT), covalently bound to the surface of 5-nm-diameter Au nanospheres by
                  its two sulfur atoms, at a distance d &lt; 1 nm and with its molecular axis parallel to the surface of the nanoparticle surface.
                  We measured a fluorescence lifetime increase of a factor of 2 at room temperature (AMDT = (4.32 Â± 0.10) ns and HS = (8.73
                  Â± 0.23) ns) and a factor of 3.4 at 4.2 K (AMDT = (2.64 Â± 0.07) ns and HS = (7.96 Â± 0.14) ns). We also found that the fluorescence
                  quantum yield of this hybrid system is not reduced, proof of a weak energy transfer between the molecular probe and the nanoparticle.
                  These results demonstrate that a molecular dipole oriented parallel to the metal surface tends to be reduced by the coupling
                  with its image.

                  interacts with the J-aggregate monolayer. Through transient absorption spectroscopy, we show that photoexcitation of the plasmon
                  in Ag nanoparticles leads to exciton dynamics that differ strongly from J-aggregates alone or for J-aggregate monolayers on
                  bulk metal surfaces. Specifically, charge-separated states with a lifetime of Â 300 ps between the J-aggregate and Ag colloid
                  are formed. The reduction of the Ag nanoparticles is shown to be a multielectron process.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_hue02">Irradiation of nanoabsorbers with pico- and nanosecond laser pulses could result in thermal effects with a spatial confinement
                  of less than 50 nm. Therefore absorbing nanoparticles may be used for creating controlled intracellular effects. Conjugates
                  of colloidal gold and alkaline phosphatase (aP) are presented as a model system for investigating protein inactivation in
                  the vicinity of strongly absorbing nanoparticles. aP was coupled either directly or via antibodies to 15 nm gold particles.
                  These conjugates were irradiated with picosecond pulses emitted by a frequency doubled Nd:YLF laser. Denaturation was detected
                  as a loss of protein function with the help of a fluorescence assay. Irradiation with 104 pulses resulted in the inactivation
                  of aP at an irradiance of 50 mJ/cm2 per pulse when the protein was coupled directly to the particles. With similar irradiation
                  parameters a significant inactivation of aP which was coupled not directly but via two antibodies to the gold, was not observed.
                  This shows that inactivating proteins with nanoabsorbers under irradiation with picosecond laser pulses is possible with a
                  high spatial confinement. However, from these experiments it is difficult to determine whether the aP was destroyed thermally
                  or whether it was inactivated by a photochemical reaction. Therefore, further experiments are needed to elucidate the damage
                  mechanisms.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_ima00">Disulfides, with a systematic series of alkyl spacers containing porphyrins at both terminals, were prepared to investigate
                  the effect of the spacer length on the structure and photoelectrochemical properties of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of
                  the porphyrins on a gold electrode. The structure of the SAMs was studied using ultraviolet (UV)-visible absorption spectroscopy
                  in transmission mode, cyclic voltammetry, UV-visible ellipsometry, and fluorescence spectroscopy. These measurements showed
                  that as the length of the spacers increases, the SAMs tend to form highly ordered structures on the gold electrodes. In addition,
                  the structures of the monolayers vary depending on the even and odd number of the methylene spacers (n). From these measurements
                  a porphyrin dimer model is proposed in that the two porphyrins take J-aggregate-like partially stacked structures in the monolayers.
                  Photoelectrochemical studies were carried out in argon-saturated Na2SO4 aqueous solution containing methyl viologen as an
                  electron carrier using the modified gold working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode.
                  The quantum yield increases in a zigzag fashion with an increase in the spacer length up to n equals 6 and then starts decreasing
                  slightly as the chain lengths become longer. A plausible explanation for the photocurrent trend comes from the following points:
                  (i) there are two competitive deactivation pathways for the excited singlet state of the porphyrin dimer, i.e., the quenching
                  by the electrode via energy transfer and by the electron carrier via electron transfer, (ii) the porphyrin aggregation enhances
                  the rate of nonradiative pathway in the excited state, and (iii) the electron transfer rate from the gold electrode to the
                  resulting porphyrin cation radical decreases with an increase of the spacer lengths. These results will provide basic information
                  for the construction of molecular assembly with photoactive function on surface.

                  of pyrene (or boron-dipyrrin) and porphyrin (energy acceptor model) reveal photoinduced singlet-singlet energy transfer from
                  the pyrene (or boron-dipyrrin) to the porphyrin on the gold surface. The boron-dipyrrin has also been combined with a reaction

                  electrode using mixed monolayers of the respective self-assembled unit. The mixed self-assembled monolayers on the gold electrode
                  have established a cascade of photoinduced energy transfer and multistep electron transfer, leading to the production of photocurrent

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_ima04">Three-dimensional porphyrin-monolayer-protected gold clusters with different chain lengths (MPCs) have been prepared to examine
                  the structure and photophysical properties, in comparison with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of the porphyrins on a flat
                  gold surface. The three-dimensional porphyrin MPCs exhibit electrochemical and photophysical properties that are much closer
                  to those of a porphyrin reference compound in solution than those of two-dimensional porphyrin SAMs on the flat gold surface.
                  The three-dimensional architectures of porphyrin MPCs with large surface area have improved the light-harvesting efficiency
                  relative to the corresponding porphyrin SAM on the two-dimensional flat gold surface. Time-resolved single photon counting
                  fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopic studies have demonstrated that undesirable quenching of the porphyrin
                  excited singlet state via energy transfer to the gold surface of the three-dimensional MPCs is much suppressed, as compared
                  to the quenching of the porphyrin SAMs on the two-dimensional flat gold surface. Both the quenching rate constants of the
                  porphyrin excited singlet state by the surfaces of bulk gold and gold nanoclusters reveal weak chain length dependence of
                  the energy transfer quenching.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_jai07">Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) in lithographically fabricated gold (Au) nanodisc pairs are investigated using
                  microabsorption spectroscopy and electrodynamic simulations. In agreement with previous work, we find that the fractional
                  plasmon wavelength shift for polarization along the interparticle axis decays nearly exponentially with the interparticle
                  gap. In addition, we find that the decay length is roughly about 0.2 in units of the particle size for different nanoparticle
                  size, shape, metal type, or medium dielectric constant. The near-exponential distance decay and the interesting "universal"
                  scaling behavior of interparticle plasmon coupling can be qualitatively explained on the basis of a dipolar-coupling model
                  as being due to the interplay of two factors: the direct dependence of the single-particle polarizability on the cubic power
                  of the particle dimension and the decay of the plasmonic near-field as the cubic power of the inverse distance. Using this
                  universal scaling behavior, we are able to derive a "plasmon ruler equation" that estimates the interparticle separation between
                  Au nanospheres in a biological system from the observed fractional shift of the plasmon band. We find good agreement of the
                  interparticle separations estimated using this equation with the experimental observations of Reinhard et al. (Nano Lett.
                  2005, 5, 2246-2252).

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_jai07a">It has been recently shown that the strength of plasmon coupling between a pair of plasmonic metal nanoparticles falls as
                  a function of the interparticle gap scaled by the particle size with a near-exponential decay trend that is universally independent
                  of nanoparticle size, shape, metal type, or medium dielectric constant. In this letter, we extend this universal scaling behavior
                  to the dielectric core-metal shell nanostructure. By using extended Mie theory simulations of silica core-metal nanoshells,
                  we show that when the shift of the nanoshell plasmon resonance wavelength scaled by the solid nanosphere resonance wavelength
                  is plotted against the shell thickness scaled by the core radius, nanoshells with different dimensions (radii) exhibit the
                  same near-exponential decay. Thus, the nanoshell system becomes physically analogous to the particle-pair system, i.e., the
                  nanoshell plasmon resonance results from the coupling of the inner shell surface (cavity) and the outer shell surface (sphere)
                  plasmons over a separation distance essentially given by the metal shell thickness, which is consistent with the plasmon hybridization
                  model of Prodan, Halas, and Nordlander. By using the universal scaling behavior in the nanoshell system, we propose a simple
                  expression for predicting the dipolar plasmon resonance of a silica-gold nanoshell of given dimensions.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_jea77">In this work we have verified the remarkable sensitivity of Raman spectroscopy for the study of adsorbed pyridine on a silver
                  surface, and extended its applicability to other nitrogen heterocycles and amines. New bands in the scattering spectrum of
                  adsorbed pyridine have been characterized, which were not previously reported, as well as the Raman intensity response of
                  all the surface pyridine bands as a function of electrode potential. As a result of these experiments, we have proposed a
                  model of the adsorbed species for pyridine in which the adsorption is anion induced, leading to an axial end-on attachment
                  to the electrode surface. The ability to obtain resonance Raman spectra with good signal-to-noise with laser powers less than
                  1.0 mW, reported here for the first time, opens up possibilities of surface Raman studies with relatively inexpensive laser
                  systems. As laser power requirements are relaxed, reliability is improved, and greater tuning ranges can be achieved for wavelength
                  dependent studies. We previously demonstrated the potential of resonance Raman spectroscopy for monitoring solution kinetic
                  behavior [2], and now have shown that NR as well as RR spectroscopy has sufficient sensitivity to extend the studies of kinetic
                  processes to include those occurring at electrode surfaces.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_kal04">We demonstrate a tomographic method for determining the degree of ellipticity and the orientation of a gold nanoparticle.
                  To do this, we attach a single nanoparticle to the end of a sharp glass fiber tip and record its plasmon spectra for different
                  incident polarizations and angles of incidence. Our measurements allow us to identify the plasmon spectra along the three
                  main axes of the particle, therefore resolving its "internal" spectral inhomogeneity. Knowledge of the plasmon resonances
                  and the orientation of a metallic nanoparticle is an important asset for controlled and quantitative studies of its interaction
                  with a single molecule.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_kel97">Titin, a giant filamentous polypeptide, is believed to play a fundamental role in maintaining sarcomeric structural integrity
                  and developing what is known as passive force in muscle. Measurements of the force required to stretch a single molecule revealed
                  that titin behaves as a highly nonlinear entropic spring. The molecule unfolds in a high-force transition beginning at 20
                  to 30 piconewtons and refolds in a low-force transition at Â 2.5 piconewtons. A fraction of the molecule (5 to 40 percent)
                  remains permanently unfolded, behaving as a wormlike chain with a persistence length (a measure of the chain's bending rigidity)
                  of 20 angstroms. Force hysteresis arises from a difference between the unfolding and refolding kinetics of the molecule relative
                  to the stretch and release rates in the experiments, respectively. Scaling the molecular data up to sarcomeric dimensions
                  reproduced many features of the passive force versus extension curve of muscle fibers.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_ker80">A model for Raman scattering by a molecule adsorbed at the surface of a spherical particle is articulated by treating the
                  molecule as a classical electric dipole. This follows Moskovits's suggestion [J. Chem. Phys. 69, 4159 (1978)] and the experiments
                  by Creighton et al. [J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. II, 75, 790 (1979)] that such a system may exhibit SERS similar to that
                  at roughened electrode surfaces. The molecule is stimulated by a primary field comprised of the incident and near-scattered
                  fields. Emission consists of the dipole field plus a scattered field, each at the shifted frequency. Addition of feedback
                  terms between the dipole and the particle makes only a negligible contribution to the fields. For pyridine adsorbed at the
                  surface of a silver sphere, the 1010-cm-1 band is enhanced by -106 if the radius is much less than the wavelengths and the
                  excitation wavelength is -382 nm, a wavelength for which the relative refractive index of silver is close to m = \/2i. Detailed
                  results are given for the effect upon the angular distribution and the polarization of the Raman emission of particle size,
                  distance from the surface, excitation wavelength, and location of the molecule upon the surface. These results simulate those
                  observed at roughened silver electrodes and suggest that the mechanism of SERS at those electrodes may resemble the electromagnetic
                  mechanism elucidated here. We predict that comparable effects should be observed for fluorescent scattering.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_kim05">The size of gold nanoparticle aggregates was controlled by manipulating the interparticle interaction. To manipulate the interparticle
                  interaction of gold nanoparticles prepared by citrate reduction, we applied the substitutive adsorption of benzyl mercaptan
                  on the particle surface in the absence of the cross-linking effect. Various experimental techniques such as UV-vis absorption
                  spectroscopy, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, quasi-elastic light scattering, and zeta-potential measurement were used
                  to characterize the nanoparticle aggregates. Our results suggest that the replacement of the trivalent citrate ions adsorbed
                  on the nanoparticle surface with monovalent benzyl mercaptan ions should destabilize the particles, causing aggregation and
                  hence the increase in the size of nanoparticle aggregates. These experimental results were successfully rationalized by the
                  classical DLVO (Derjaguin-Landau-Vervey-Overbeek) theory that describes the interparticle interaction and colloidal stability
                  in solution. Our findings suggest that the control of surface potential is crucial in the design of stable gold nanoparticle

                  vector formalism, which is mathematically simpler than the widely-adapted Lorenz-Mie approach which uses the complicated vector
                  harmonic expansions. Results are obtained for both radiative and nonradiative transfer when the molecule is located outside
                  or inside the surface. Numerical results are given for the cases of a surface, cavity and aerosol, and comparison with other
                  works is made.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_kne02">Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a spectroscopic technique which combines modern laser spectroscopy with the exciting
                  optical properties of metallic nanostructures, resulting in strongly increased Raman signals when molecules are attached to
                  nanometre-sized gold and silver structures. The effect provides the structural information content of Raman spectroscopy together
                  with ultrasensitive detection limits, allowing Raman spectroscopy of single molecules. Since SERS takes place in the local
                  fields of metallic nanostructures, the lateral resolution of the technique is determined by the confinement of the local fields,
                  which can be two orders of magnitude better than the diffraction limit. Moreover, SERS is an analytical technique, which can
                  give information on surface and interface processes. SERS opens up exciting opportunities in the field of biophysical and
                  biomedical spectroscopy, where it provides ultrasensitive detection and characterization of biophysically/biomedically relevant
                  molecules and processes as well as a vibrational spectroscopy with extremely high spatial resolution. The article briefly
                  introduces the SERS effect and reviews contemporary SERS studies in biophysics/biochemistry and in life sciences. Potential
                  and limitations of the technique are briefly discussed.

                  between 100 nm and 20 Âµm. These experimental findings demonstrate that NIR SERS on colloidal silver clusters is an excellent

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_kni07">We show that a nanoparticle can serve as an efficient antenna for coupling of visible light into propagating plasmons of an
                  Ag nanowire. For long wires, the coupling is maximal for incident light polarized perpendicular to the nanowire. For sub-10-m
                  nanowires, the polarization corresponding to maximum emission from the ends of the nanowire was found to be strongly dependent
                  on the nanowire geometry and position of the vicinal nanoparticle. This nanoparticle antenna-based approach offers a potential
                  strategy for optimizing plasmon coupling into nanoscale metallic waveguides.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_kru99">This paper reports two fundamental observations on the size-dependent optical properties of colloidal gold nanoparticles.
                  First, faceted gold nanocrystals in the size range of 63 Â± 3 nm have been found to be highly efficient for surface-enhanced
                  Raman scattering (SERS). These nanocrystals are identified from a heterogeneous population for large optical enhancement at
                  647-nm laser excitation. Second, spatially isolated single gold particles emit Stokes-shifted Raman photons in an intermittent
                  on-and-off fashion. In contrast to population-averaged studies, blinking surface-enhanced Raman scattering is a signature
                  of single-particle (or even single-molecule) behavior. By directly measuring optical enhancement and time-resolved emission
                  on single nanoparticles, this work opens new possibilities in studying the mechanisms of SERS, in developing metal tips for
                  near-field optical microscopy, and in designing new nanostructured materials.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_kuh70">The decay time of the luminescence of a molecule S in front of a metal mirror depends markedly on its distance from the mirror.
                  This phenomenon is quantitatively explained by considering the radiation field of this dipole, given by Hertz classical equation.
                  This field arrives at the molecule, after being reflected at the mirror, with a retardation of the order of 10-15 sec. The
                  decay time of the luminescence depends on the phase shift produced by this retardation, and thus on the ratio of the distance
                  of the oscillator from the mirror, and the wavelength of the emitted light. By measuring the distance dependence of the decay
                  time of the luminescence this retardation effect can be studied. In quantum-mechanical terms the phenomenon can be described
                  as being due to a stimulation or inhibition of the emission of the light quantum. In contrast to the known cases of stimulated
                  emission, the stimulating field is the radiation field of the emitter quantum itself. The energy transfer from an excited
                  molecule S to an acceptor A can be treated in a similar manner by considering the phenomenon as a retardation effect. In classical
                  terms the field of S induces A to oscillate, and the induced field of A arriving at S slows down this oscillator. Simple equations
                  are given for the energy transfer from an excited dipole or quadrupole, and for a row of many dipoles, oscillating in phase,
                  to a weakly absorbing acceptor layer. The latter case is considered as a model for a J-aggregating dye and by comparison with
                  experimental data conclusions concerning the size of a J aggregate are drawn.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_lak02">Metallic surfaces can have unusual effects on fluorophores such as increasing or decreasing the rates of radiative decay and
                  the rates of resonance energy transfer (RET). In the present article we describe the effects of metallic silver island films
                  on the emission spectra, lifetimes, and energy transfer for several fluorophores. The fluorophores are not covalently coupled
                  to the silver islands so that there are a range of fluorophore-to-metal distances. We show that proximity of fluorophores
                  to the silver islands results in increased fluorescence intensity, with the largest enhancement for the lowest-quantum-yield
                  fluorophores. Importantly, the metal-induced increases in intensity are accompanied by decreased lifetimes and increased photostability.
                  These effects demonstrate that the silver islands have increased the radiative decay rates of the fluorophore. For solvent-sensitive
                  fluorophores the emission spectra shifted to shorted wavelengths in the presence of the silver islands, which is consistent
                  with a decrease of the apparent lifetime for fluorophores near the metal islands. We also observed an increased intensity
                  and blue spectral shift for the protein human glyoxalase, which displays a low quantum yield for its intrinsic tryptophan
                  emission. In this case the blue shift is thought to be due to increased emission from a buried low-quantum-yield tryptophan
                  residue. Increased intensities were also observed for the intrinsic emission of the nucleic acid bases adenine and thymine
                  and for single-stranded 15-mers poly(T) and poly(C). And finally, we observed increased RET for donors and acceptors in solution
                  and when bound to double-helical DNA. These results demonstrate that metallic particles can be used to modify the emission
                  from intrinsic and extrinsic fluorophores in biochemical systems.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_lak05">Metallic particles and surfaces display diverse and complex optical properties. Examples include the intense colors of noble
                  metal colloids, surface plasmon resonance absorption by thin metal films, and quenching of excited fluorophores near the metal
                  surfaces. Recently, the interactions of fluorophores with metallic particles and surfaces (metals) have been used to obtain
                  increased fluorescence intensities, to develop assays based on fluorescence quenching by gold colloids, and to obtain directional
                  radiation from fluorophores near thin metal films. For metal-enhanced fluorescence it is difficult to predict whether a particular
                  metal structure, such as a colloid, fractal, or continuous surface, will quench or enhance fluorescence. In the present report
                  we suggest how the effects of metals on fluorescence can be explained using a simple concept, based on radiating plasmons
                  (RPs). The underlying physics may be complex but the concept is simple to understand. According to the RP model, the emission
                  or quenching of a fluorophore near the metal can be predicted from the optical properties of the metal structures as calculated
                  from electrodynamics, Mie theory, and/or Maxwell?s equations. For example, according to Mie theory and the size and shape
                  of the particle, the extinction of metal colloids can be due to either absorption or scattering. Incident energy is dissipated
                  by absorption. Far-field radiation is created by scattering. Based on our model small colloids are expected to quench fluorescence
                  because absorption is dominant over scattering. Larger colloids are expected to enhance fluorescence because the scattering
                  component is dominant over absorption. The ability of a metal?s surface to absorb or reflect light is due to wavenumber matching
                  requirements at the metal?sample interface. Wavenumber matching considerations can also be used to predict whether fluorophores
                  at a given distance from a continuous planar surface will be emitted or quenched. These considerations suggest that the so
                  called ?lossy surface waves? which quench fluorescence are due to induced electron oscillations which cannot radiate to the
                  far-field because wavevector matching is not possible. We suggest that the energy from the fluorophores thought to be lost
                  by lossy surface waves can be recovered as emission by adjustment of the sample to allow wavevector matching. The RP model
                  provides a rational approach for designing fluorophore?metal configurations with the desired emissive properties and a basis
                  for nanophotonic fluorophore technology.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_lar07">Abstract: The optical responses of 75-150 nm diameter gold nanorings to changes in local refractive index have been quantified
                  by near-infrared extinction spectroscopy and compared to DDA calculations and an analytical approach. The "bulk" refractive
                  index sensitivities of gold nanorings are substantially (&gt;5 times) larger than those of nanodisks with similar diameters.
                  Nanorings retain a significantly larger sensitivity than nanodisks at the same spectral position, demonstrating a clear shape
                  dependence that may correlate to a systematic difference in the influence of the dielectric substrate. The nanoring bulk refractive
                  index sensitivity scales linearly with plasmon peak position. The spectral sensitivity to thin films of alkanethiols gave
                  a shift of Â 5.2 nm/CH2 unit while bulk sensitivities as high as 880 nm/RIU were observed, the highest such reported sensitivities.
                  Both bulk and thin dielectric film sensitivities correlated well with theory. Real-time label-free monitoring of protein binding
                  via molecular recognition was demonstrated.

                  Prototypical biomolecules, such as D-biotin and streptavidin pair, were utilized to connect NPs and NWs in solution. It was
                  found that Au NPs form a dense shell around a CdTe NW. The superstructure demonstrated unusual optical effects related to
                  the long-distance interaction of the semiconductor and noble metal nanocolloids. The NW-NP complex showed 5-fold enhancement
                  of luminescence intensity and a blue shift of the emission peak as compared to unconjugated NW. The system was theoretically
                  examined in a simple model of CdTe NW coaxially surrounded by an Au shell, which gives excellent agreement with experimental
                  data. The combination of time-resolved luminescence and calculations demonstrated that increase of fluorescence intensity
                  occurs due to stimulation of photon emission by an electromagnetic field generated around the Au NP. The process is reminiscent
                  of SERS, although displaying smaller enhancement factors. Importantly, the luminescence enhancement should be treated as a
                  collective response of Au-NPs, rather than a result of isolated NP-NW interactions.

                  fluorescence decay). On silver islands films the shortening in fluorescence lifetime is more drastic and is nearly independent
                  of the intermolecular distance. This behaviour suggests an electrodynamic interaction between dye monomers and plasmons in
                  metal particles, modified by a damping influence of dye dimers.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_ler07">Abstract: We study the importance of an often-overlooked aspect of surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF): the spectral profile
                  modification (SPM) that should accompany any plasmon-resonance-mediated enhancement or quenching of the fluorescence close
                  to metal surfaces. We argue theoretically and demonstrate experimentally that under SEF conditions the plasmon resonances
                  affect not only the fluorescence intensity (enhancement or quenching) but also its spectral profile, sometimes to a point
                  where the original fluorescence spectrum may no longer be recognizable as such. Moreover, we argue that the modified excited-state
                  decay rate may, under certain conditions, become comparable to the internal relaxation rate. This effect leads to a new fluorescence
                  mechanism, which we call fast-dynamics SEF (FDSEF), where the spectral profile is affected by the relaxation dynamics in the
                  excited state (in addition to the plasmon resonance). Finally, we propose that the so-called surface-enhanced Raman scattering
                  (SERS) continuum may, in many instances, be interpreted in terms of a SPM of the SEF (in its simplest form or as FDSEF). Experimental
                  evidence using highly uniform nanolithography-prepared gold nanostructures are provided to support these ideas.

                  is studied for the purpose of the enhancement of a single molecule's fluorescence due to the coupling surface plasmon resonance
                  of the dimer. For simplicity, a two-dimensional transverse magnetic model is used for simulation, and a set of new surface
                  integral equations is developed for the calculation of the electromagnetic field. The process of fluorescence is simply divided
                  into two stages, the excitation and the emission, for analysis. For the former, an incident plane wave illuminating the structure
                  to excite the molecule is simulated. For the latter, another model, an electric dipole within the gap of the dimer, is used
                  to simulate the excited molecule interacting with the dimer. The results show that a metallic dimer behaves as a nanolens
                  to provide a strong local electric field in the gap to excite the molecule, and its quantum yield behaves as a low-pass filter
                  as well as an orientizer for the fluorescence emission.

                  gold nanoparticles mediated by cyanine dyes. The combination of the positively charged indolenine cyanine dyes and the negatively
                  charged gold nanoparticles is shown to form a J-aggregate bridged assembly of nanoparticles, in addition to hydrophobic interparticle
                  and electrostatic dye-particle interactions. Such interparticle interactions and reactivities are studied by probing the absorption
                  of J-aggregates and fluorescence from the dyes and the surface plasmon resonance absorption from the nanoparticles. The J-aggregation
                  of the dyes adsorbed on the nanoparticles is shown to play an important role in the assembly of nanoparticles. The spectral
                  evolution of the J-band of the dyes and the surface plasmon resonance band of the nanoparticles was found to be sensitive
                  to the nature of the charge and the structure of the dyes. The fluorescence quenching for the dyes was shown to be quantitatively
                  related to the surface coverage of the dyes on the nanocrystal surfaces. These findings have provided important information
                  for assessing a two-step process involving a rapid adsorption of the dyes on the nanoparticles and a subsequent assembly of
                  the nanoparticles involving a combination of interparticle J-aggregation and hydrophobic interactions of the adsorbed dyes.
                  The results are discussed in terms of the structural effects of the dyes, and the interparticle molecular interactions and
                  reactivities, which provide important physical and chemical insights into the design of dye-nanoparticle structured functional
                  nanomaterials.

                  adsorbate layer consisting of 16 molecules, were investigated. These clusters show a distinct absorption onset at 1.3 eV corresponding
                  to the opening of an electronic gap within the conduction band (HOMO-LUMO gap). Here we report on the radiative properties
                  of these molecular-like gold clusters. By using a combination of different detectors with sensitivities in the visible to
                  the infrared (2.0-0.8 eV), a broad luminescence extending over this entire spectral range was observed. Our results further
                  suggest that the luminescence can be separated into two bands with maxima around 1.5 and 1.15 eV indicating that radiative
                  recombination between the ground state and two distinctively different excited states takes place. The origin of the observed

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_mag02">Absolute fluorescence quantum yields are reported for the rhodamine 6G cation and the fluorescein dianion dyes in nine solvents.
                  This information is combined with previously reported fluorescence lifetimes to deduce radiative and nonradiative decay rates.
                  Along the alcohol series from methanol to octanol, rhodamine 6G displays an increasing radiative rate, in parallel with the
                  square of the refractive index increase, and a slightly decreasing nonradiative rate. Fluorescein is different: the apparent
                  radiative rate actually decreases, suggesting that the emissive species is perturbed in some fashion. For both dyes, fluorescence
                  yields are enhanced in D2O, rising to 0.98, in parallel with a corresponding increase in lifetimes. Protonated solvents invariably
                  give shorter lifetimes and lower quantum yields, contrary to some previous speculation. From this work and an analysis of
                  existing literature values, more precise values have been obtained for two previously proposed absolute quantum yield standards.
                  The yield of fluorescein in 0.1 N NaOH(aq) is 0.925 +- 0.015, and for rhodamine 6G in ethanol, it is 0.950 +- 0.015. In both
                  cases, the solutions are assumed to be in the limit of low concentration, excited close to their long-wave absorption band
                  and at room temperature but may be either air-saturated or free of oxygen.

                  asymmetries. We show here that these resonances are associated with the electromagnetic coupling between the analyte (probe)
                  and the metal. The work demonstrates the use of the anti-Stokes/Stokes ratio as a tool to understand the hierarchy of resonances
                  in the SERS problem, which is essential for quantification purposes.

                  particles via a terminal sulfhydryl group. We found a 12-fold increase in fluorescence intensity and 25-fold decrease in lifetime
                  for a fluorescein residue positioned 23 nucleotides from the silver surface compared to labeled oligomers in free solution.
                  Similar results were found for a 23-mer labeled with five fluorescein residues. The absence of long lifetime components in
                  the intensity decays suggests that all labeled oligomers are bound to silver and affected similarly by the metallic surfaces.
                  These results provide the basic knowledge needed to begin use of metal-enhanced fluorescence for the detection of target sequences
                  in simple formats potentially without a washing separation step. The use of metal-enhanced fluorescence provides a generic
                  approach to obtaining a hybridization-dependent increase in fluorescence with most, if not all, commonly used fluorophores.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_max02">Colloidal gold nanocrystals have been used to develop a new class of nanobiosensors that is able to recognize and detect specific
                  DNA sequences and single-base mutations in a homogeneous format. At the core of this biosensor is a 2.5-nm gold nanoparticle
                  that functions as both a nano-scaffold and a nano-quencher (efficient energy acceptor). Attached to this core are oligonucleotide
                  molecules labeled with a thiol group at one end and a fluorophore at the other. This hybrid bio/inorganic construct is found
                  to spontaneously assemble into a constrained arch-like conformation on the particle surface. Binding of target molecules results
                  in a conformational change, which restores the fluorescence of the quenched fluorophore. Unlike conventional molecular beacons
                  with a stem-and-loop structure, the nanoparticle probes do not require a stem, and their background fluorescence increases
                  little with temperature. In comparison with the organic quencher Dabcyl (4,4'-dimethylaminophenyl azo benzoic acid), metal
                  nanoparticles have unique structural and optical properties for new applications in biosensing and molecular engineering.

                  1 (SP1) is a boiling-stable ring protein complex, 11 nm in diameter, which self-assembles from 12 identical monomers. SP1
                  can be utilized to form large ordered arrays; it can be easily modified by genetic engineering to produce various mutants;
                  it is also capable of binding gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and thus forming protein-GNP chains made of alternating SP1s and GNPs.
                  We report the formation and the protocols leading to the formation of those nanostructures and their characterization by transmission
                  electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and electrostatic force microscopy. Further control over the GNP interdistances
                  within the protein-GNP chains may lead to the formation of nanowires and structures that may be useful for nanoelectronics.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_mil91">An apparatus is described that can determine electrophoretic mobilities of polar and nonpolar colloidal dispersions down to
                  1 x 10-12 m2 s-1 V-1, with typical resolutions of 0.5 to 5%, depending on the nature of the dispersion being studied. The
                  diffusion coefficient and settling/convection velocity of the sample may be determined simultaneously with the electrophoretic
                  mobility in real time. The technique, phase analysis light scattering (PALS), is based upon classical laser-Doppler electrophoresis,
                  but employs signal processing of the time domain phase information within the scattered light signal, rather than analysis
                  of its frequency spectrum. This allows much smaller electric field strengths to be employed, thereby alleviating the usual
                  heating problems associated with electrophoretic studies of nonpolar dispersions. PALS measurements of typical aqueous latex
                  dispersions with large mobilities and some nonpolar dispersions with very small mobilities are presented to illustrate the
                  versatility of this technique.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_mir96">Colloidal particles of metals and semiconductors have potentially useful optical, optoelectronic and material properties1?4
                  that derive from their small (nanoscopic) size. These properties might lead to applications including chemical sensors, spectro-scopic
                  enhancers, quantum dot and nanostructure fabrication, and microimaging methods2?4. A great deal of control can now be exercised
                  over the chemical composition, size and polydis-persity1,2 of colloidal particles, and many methods have been developed for
                  assembling them into useful aggregates and materials. Here we describe a method for assembling colloidal gold nanoparticles
                  rationally and reversibly into macroscopic aggregates. The method involves attaching to the surfaces of two batches of 13-nm
                  gold particles non-complementary DNA oligo-nucleotides capped with thiol groups, which bind to gold. When we add to the solution
                  an oligonucleotide duplex with 'sticky ends' that are complementary to the two grafted sequences, the nanoparticles self-assemble
                  into aggregates. This assembly process can be reversed by thermal denaturation. This strategy should now make it possible
                  to tailor the optical, electronic and structural properties of the colloidal aggregates by using the specificity of DNA interactions
                  to direct the interactions between particles of different size and composition.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_mol04">A general overview of the optoelectronic properties of pi-conjugated polymers is presented. Two types of polymer are discerned:
                  interchangeable structures of the same energy (degenerate), such as polyacetylene; and non-degenerate polymers, such as poly(para-phenylene).
                  The band structures of degenerate and non-degenerate polymers are related to their conductivities in doped and non-doped states.
                  In both cases, disorder and impurities play an important role in conductivity. Polarons, bipolarons and excitons are detailed
                  with respect to doping and charge transfers. Given the fibrillic nature of these materials, the variable range hopping (VRH)
                  law for semiconducting polymers is modified to account for metallic behaviours. Optoelectronic propertiesÂ -Â electroluminescence
                  and photovoltaic activityÂ -Â are explained in terms of HOMO and LUMO bands, polaron-exciton and charge movement over one or
                  more molecules. The properties of H- or J-type aggregates and their effects on transitions are related to target applications.
                  Device structures of polymer light-emitting diodes are explicitly linked to optimising polaron recombinations and overall
                  quantum efficiencies. The particularly promising use of ?-conjugated polymers in photovoltaic devices is discussed.

                  and photobleaching of a two-level atom radiating anywhere inside or outside a complex spherical nanoshell, i.e., a stratified
                  sphere consisting of alternating silica and gold concentric spherical shells, are studied. The changes in the spectroscopic
                  properties of an atom interacting with complex nanoshells are significantly enhanced, often more than two orders of magnitude,
                  compared to the same atom interacting with a homogeneous dielectric sphere. The detected fluorescence intensity can be enhanced
                  by 5 or more orders of magnitude. The changes strongly depend on the nanoshell parameters and the atom position. When an atom
                  approaches a metal shell, decay rates are strongly enhanced yet fluorescence yield exhibits a well-known quenching. Rather
                  contra-intuitively, the Ohmic loss contribution to the nonradiative decay rates for an atomic dipole within the silica core
                  of larger nanoshells may be decreasing when the silica core-inner gold shell interface is approached. The quasi-static result
                  that the radial frequency shift in a close proximity of a spherical shell interface is approximately twice as large as the
                  tangential frequency shift appears to apply also for complex nanoshells. Significantly modified spectroscopic properties (see

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_mos78">Greatly enhanced Raman scattering from monolayers of pyridine adsorbed on silver has been reported by several authors. I propose
                  that the anomalous intensity arises from preresonant or resonant excitations of conduction electron resonances in adsorbate
                  covered metal bumps on the surface. The bumps form a two-dimensional colliodlike layer which displays a collective resonance
                  at a frequency which depends on the bump density. The model can account for the disparate excitation functions reported by
                  two groups in terms of varying degrees of roughness. The apparent lack of enhancement with metals other than Group Ib is also
                  explained.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_mos85">In 1978 it was discovered, largely through the work of Fleischmann, Van Duyne, Creighton, and their coworkers that molecules
                  adsorbed on specially prepared silver surfaces produce a Raman spectrum that is at times a millionfold more intense than expected.
                  This effect was dubbed surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Since then the effect has been demonstrated with many molecules
                  and with a number of metals, including Cu, Ag, Au, Li, Na, K, In, Pt, and Rh. In addition, related phenomena such as surface-enhanced
                  second-harmonic generation, four-wave mixing, absorption, and fluorescence have been observed. Although not all fine points
                  of the enhancement mechanism have been clarified, the majority view is that the largest contributor to the intensity amplification
                  results from the electric field enhancement that occurs in the vicinity of small, interacting metal particles that are illuminated
                  with light resonant or near resonant with the localized surface-plasmon frequency of the metal structure. Small in this context
                  is gauged in relation to the wavelength of light. The special preparations required to produce the effect, which include among
                  other techniques electrochemical oxidation-reduction cycling, deposition of metal on very cold substrates, and the generation
                  of metal-island films and colloids, is now understood to be necessary as a means of producing surfaces with appropriate electromagnetic
                  resonances that may couple to electromagnetic fields either by generating rough films (as in the case of the former two examples)
                  or by placing small metal particles in close proximity to one another (as in the case of the latter two). For molecules chemisorbed
                  on SERS-active surface there exists a "chemical enhancement" in addition to the electromagnetic effect. Although difficult
                  to measure accurately, the magnitude of this effect rarely exceeds a factor of 10 and is best thought to arise from the modification
                  of the Raman polarizability tensor of the adsorbate resulting from the formation of a complex between the adsorbate and the
                  metal. Rather than an enhancement mechanism, the chemical effect is more logically to be regarded as a change in the nature
                  and identity of the adsorbate.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_mul00">The use of nanometre thick silica shells as a means to stabilize metal clusters and semiconductor particles is discussed,
                  and its potential advantages over conventional organic capping agents are presented. Shell deposition depends on control of
                  the double layer potential, and requires priming of the core particle surface. Chemical reactions are possible within the
                  core, via diffusion of reactants through the shell layer. Quantum dots can be stabilized against photochemical degradation
                  through silica deposition, whilst retaining strong fluorescence quantum yields and their size dependent optical properties.
                  Ordered 3D and 2D arrays of a macroscopic size with uniform particle spacing can be created. Thin colloid films can also be
                  created with well-defined interparticle spacing, allowing controlled coupling of exciton and surface plasmon modes to be investigated.
                  A number of future core-shell nanocomposite structures are postulated, including quantum bubbles and single electron capacitors

                  within the Drude model. The absorption spectrum of a metal sol in water is shown to be strongly affected by cathodic or anodic
                  polarization, chemisorption, metal adatom deposition, and alloying. Anion adsorption leads to strong damping of the free electron
                  absorption. Cathodic polarization leads to anion desorption. Underpotential deposition (upd) of electropositive metal layers
                  results in dramatic blue-shifts of the surface plasmon band of the substrate. The deposition of just 0.1 monolayer can be
                  readily detected by eye. In some cases alloying occurs spontaneously during upd. Alloy formation can be ascertained from the
                  optical absorption spectrum in the case of gold deposition onto silver sols. The underpotential deposition of silver adatoms
                  onto palladium leads to the formation of a homogeneous silver shell, but the mean free path is less than predicted, due to
                  lattice strain in the shell.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_mus07">We demonstrate a strong, 5-fold enhancement of the radiative decay rate from highly efficient fluorescent dye molecules around
                  resonant optical nanoantennas. The plasmonic modes of individual gold dimer antennas are tuned by the particle length and
                  the antenna gap, providing control over both the spectral resonance position and the near-field mode profile of the nanoantenna.
                  Resonant enhancement of the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of a fluorescent dye is observed, resulting in an increase
                  of the internal quantum efficiency from 40% up to 53% for single antennas, and up to 59% for antenna clusters. This improvement
                  of the already high quantum efficiency of the dye molecules is in agreement with electrodynamic model calculations that predict
                  a maximum attainable efficiency around 80% due to nonradiative losses in the metal.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_naz02">We studied fluorescence intensity, polarization and lifetime of some commonly used fluorophores conjugated to oligodeoxyribonucleotides
                  with different primary and secondary structures. We found that fluorescence intensity can increase or decrease upon hybridization
                  of the labeled strand to its complement depending on the sequence and position of the fluorophore. Up to 10-fold quenching
                  of the fluorescence upon hybridization was observed when the dye moiety was attached close to the 3' end and the 3'-terminal
                  base was either dG or dC. No quenching upon hybridization was observed when the dye was positioned within the same sequence
                  context but close to the 5' end. The presence of a dG overhang quenches the fluorescence less efficiently than a blunt end
                  dG-dC or dC-dG base pair. When located internally in the double strand, the dG-dC base pair does not affect the fluorescence
                  of the nearby dye. Guanosine in a single-stranded oligonucleotide quenches the fluorescence of nearby dye by &lt;2-fold. Upon
                  duplex formation, this quenching is eliminated and the fluorescence increases. This increase can only be detected when the
                  fluorophore is located at least 6 nt from the terminal dG-dC base pair. The change of fluorescence polarization upon duplex
                  formation inversely correlates with the change of intensity. Fluorescein conjugated to a single-stranded oligonucleotide or
                  a duplex undergoes a bi-exponential decay with 4 and 1 ns lifetimes.

                  at 630 nm with a quantum yield of 1 Ã 10?6 upon the photoexcitation at 395 nm to the lowest electronic excited state. The
                  visible PL is assigned to phosphorescence originating from a triplet-like excited state based on the large Stokes shift (1.2
                  eV). The PL quantum yield was enhanced up to ?0.9%, greater by eight orders of magnitude than that of bulk gold, by thickening
                  the protecting layer and freezing a solvent at 77 K. The emission peak energy is discussed within the context of core-size
                  dependent electronic structures by comparison with those of thiolate-protected gold clusters reported in the literature.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_neg05">Small gold clusters (Â 1 nm) protected by molecules of a tripeptide, glutathione (GSH), were prepared by reductive decomposition
                  of Au(I)-SG polymers at a low temperature and separated into a number of fractions by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE).
                  Chemical compositions of the fractionated clusters determined previously by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry
                  (Negishi, Y. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 6518) were reassessed by taking advantage of freshly prepared samples, higher
                  mass resolution, and more accurate mass calibration; the nine smallest components are reassigned to Au10(SG)10, Au15(SG)13,
                  Au18(SG)14, Au22(SG)16, Au22(SG)17, Au25(SG)18, Au29(SG)20, Au33(SG)22, and Au39(SG)24. These assignments were further confirmed
                  by measuring the mass spectra of the isolated Au:S(h-G) clusters, where h-GSH is a homoglutathione. It is proposed that a
                  series of the isolated Au:SG clusters corresponds to kinetically trapped intermediates of the growing Au cores. The relative
                  abundance of the isolated clusters was correlated well with the thermodynamic stabilities against unimolecular decomposition.
                  The electronic structures of the isolated Au:SG clusters were probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and optical
                  spectroscopy. The Au(4f) XPS spectra illustrate substantial electron donation from the gold cores to the GS ligands in the
                  Au:SG clusters. The optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra indicate that the electronic structures of the Au:SG
                  clusters are well quantized; embryos of the sp band of the bulk gold evolve remarkably depending on the number of the gold
                  atoms and GS ligands. The comparison of these spectral data with those of sodium Au(I) thiomalate and 1.8 nm Au:SG nanocrystals
                  (NCs) reveals that the subnanometer-sized Au clusters thiolated constitute a distinct class of binary system which lies between
                  the Au(I)-thiolate complexes and thiolate-protected Au NCs.

                  For single rhodamine 6G molecules adsorbed on the selected nanoparticles, the intrinsic Raman enhancement factors were on
                  the order of 1014 to 1015, much larger than the ensemble-averaged values derived from conventional measurements. This enormous

                  with excited-state relaxation in tris-(2,2'-bipyridine)ruthenium(II). The data reveal dynamics associated with the temporal

                  understanding and designing molecular-based electron transfer, artificial photosynthetic, and photovoltaic assemblies in which

                  functional calculations. The cluster has a characteristic structure with Oh molecular symmetry, and eight (111) facets of
                  a centered cuboctahedral Au13 core cluster are fully passivated by eight methanethiolates. The bond distance between two neighboring
                  gold atoms (3.673 {\AA}) is much larger than that of the bare Au13 cluster (2.929 {\AA}), whereas the Au-S bond distance is
                  2.403 {\AA}. This atomic rearrangement means that the methanethiolates stabilize the enlarged bare Au13 cluster by bonding
                  to the (111) hollow sites of the bare cluster. The absorption spectrum of the [Au13(SCH3)8]3+ cluster is simulated within
                  time-dependent density functional theory. The spectrum shows clear absorption peaks and each peak is assigned to specific
                  excitation processes.

                  on the surface to form a self-assembled, dsDNA bridge between the two gold contacts. The adsorption of a ssDNA monolayer at
                  each gold interface eliminates non-specific interactions of the dsDNA with the surface, allowing bridge formation only upon
                  hybridization. The technique used, in addition to providing a good electrical contact, offers topographical contrast between
                  the gold nanoparticles and the non-hybridized surface and enables accurate location of the bridge for the electrical measurements.
                  Reproducible AFM conductivity measurements have been performed and significant qualitative differences were detected between
                  conductivity in single- and double-strand DNA. The ssDNA was found to be insulating over a 4 eV range between Â±2 V under the

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_olk07">The distance- and polarization-dependent near-field enhancement of two coupling metal nanoparticles (MNPs) is analyzed by
                  means of the novel scanning particle enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SPRM) technique. In contrast to single MNP Raman experiments,
                  the near-field coupling between two dissimilar MNPs as followed here leads to a Raman hot spot yielding an extra enhancement
                  factor of 17.6 and 20, as proven here both in experiment and in theory. Three-dimensional electric field calculations for
                  our two-particle arrangements were performed using the semianalytical multiple-multipole method. An excellent agreement is
                  found to our experiments, in which we inspect the interaction between a "scanning" 30 nm gold MNP (Au30) and a "fixed" 80
                  nm Au MNP (Au80). The Au80 MNP is attached to the apex of an optical fiber manipulator and exposed to the Gaussian focus of
                  a high NA = 1.45 objective at = 532 nm. A monolayer of 1-octanethiol molecules covering the Au80 MNP serves as the electric
                  field prober when scanning the Au30 MNP through the optical focus. This constellation allows recording the Raman signatures
                  from a very low number of well-confined molecules. Moreover, also the spectral and spatial dependence could be explored with
                  a superb sensitivity and very low integration time.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_ols01">Immobilized gold colloid particles coated with a C-18 alkylsilane layer have been characterized as a substrate for surface-enhanced
                  Raman scattering (SERS) studies of adsorption onto hydrophobic surfaces. Atomic force microscopy images, optical extinction
                  spectra, and SERS measurements are reported as a function of accumulation of gold colloid on glass. As the metal particles
                  become increasingly aggregated on the surface, the SERS enhancement increases until the plasmon resonance shifts to wavelengths
                  longer than the excitation laser. The gold colloid substrates are stable and exhibit reproducible SERS enhancement. When octadecyltrimethoxysilane
                  is self-assembled over the gold, the metal surface is protected from exposure to solution-phase species, as evidenced by the
                  inhibition of chemisorption of a disulfide reagent to the overcoated gold surface. The results show that interactions with
                  gold can be blocked by a silane layer so as not to significantly influence physisorption of molecules at the C-18/solution
                  interface. The SERS enhancement from these C-18-overcoated gold substrates is reproducible for different films prepared from
                  the same colloidal suspension; the substrates are also stable with time and upon exposure to laser irradiation.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_ott92">On the basis of different types of experiments, the authors develop implicitly the model of surface-enhanced Raman scattering
                  (SERS) of adsorbates on metal surfaces. The long-range enhancement by resonances of the macroscopic laser and Stokes field
                  is separated quantitatively from the metal electron-mediated resonance Raman effect. The latter mechanism proceeds by increased
                  electron-photon coupling at an atomically rough surface and by temporary charge transfer to orbitals of the adsorbates. This
                  model can account for the chemical specificity and vibrational selectivity of SERS and (partly) for the SERS specificity of
                  the various metals.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_oub04">The optical properties of metallodielectric nanostructures, variations of a core-shell geometry, are investigated using the
                  finite difference time domain method. This method provides a convenient, systematic, and general approach for calculating
                  the optical response of a nanostructure of arbitrary symmetry and geometry to an incident light wave. Properties such as the
                  optical absorption and scattering cross sections as well as the local electromagnetic fields and induced charge densities
                  at the surfaces of the nanostructures can be obtained by this method. Issues of convergence with grid size and other simulation
                  parameters are discussed in detail. The method is applied to uniform single nanoshells, nanoshells with surface defects, and
                  nanoshells with shape distortions from a spherical geometry. The results show that, while defects can significantly affect
                  local surface field enhancements, far field properties such as optical absorption and scattering spectra can be remarkably
                  insensitive to defects and distortions.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_oub05">Abstract: The optical properties of metallic nanoshell dimers are investigated using the finite difference time domain (FDTD)
                  method. We discuss issues of numerical convergence specific for the dimer system. We present results for both homodimers and
                  heterodimers. The results show that retardation effects must be taken into account for an accurate description of realistic
                  size nanoparticle dimers. The optical properties of the nanoshell dimer are found to be strongly polarization dependent. Maximal
                  coupling between the nanoshells in a dimer occurs when the electric field of the incident pulse is aligned parallel to the
                  dimer axis. The wavelengths of the peaks in the extinction cross section of the dimer are shown to vary by more than 100 nm,
                  depending on the incident electric field polarization. The calculations show that electric field enhancements in the dimer
                  junctions depend strongly on dimer separation. The maximum field enhancements occur in the dimer junction and at the expense
                  of a reduced electric field enhancement in other regions of space. We investigate the usefulness of nanoshell dimers substrates
                  for SERS by integrating the fourth power of the electric field enhancements around the surfaces of the nanoparticles as a
                  function of dimer separation and wavelength. The SERS efficiency is shown to depend strongly on dimer separation but much
                  weaker than the fourth power of the maximum electric field enhancement at a particular point. The SERS efficiency is also
                  found to depend strongly on the wavelength of the incident light. Maximum SERS efficiency occurs for resonant excitation of
                  the dimer plasmons.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_pah87">We have characterized a streptavidin product that had been reduced to a minimal size that still retained full biotin-binding
                  activity. This core streptavidin is proteolyzed at both ends at points that correspond closely with the termini of hen egg
                  white avidin. Core streptavidin is more soluble than is the parent molecule. We have grown three different types of crystals
                  of core streptavidin. The symmetry properties of these crystals prove that the molecule is a tetramer organized in tetrahedral
                  (D2) point symmetry. The crystallographic response to the interaction of biotin with core streptavidin indicates that some
                  conformational change accompanies ligand binding. We are attempting to determine the three-dimensional structure of streptavidin
                  and its complex with selenobiotin from these crystals of core streptavidin.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_par02">Water-soluble, highly fluorescent, silanized semiconductor nanocrystals with different surface charges were synthesized. To
                  covalently attach the nanocrystals to biological macromolecules with a variety of mild coupling chemistries, the outermost
                  siloxane shells were derivatized with thiol, amino, or carboxyl functional groups. Single- or double-stranded DNA was coupled
                  to the nanocrystal surfaces by using commercially available bifunctional cross-linker. Conjugation had little effect on the
                  optical properties of the nanocrystals, and the resulting conjugates were more stable than previously reported systems. By
                  using the strategies developed in this study, most biomolecules can be covalently coupled to semiconductor nanocrystals. These
                  nanocrystal-DNA conjugates promise to be a versatile tool for fluorescence imaging and probing of biological systems.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_pel99">Membrane potential around single molecules has been measured by using the nonlinear optical phenomenon of second harmonic
                  generation. This advance results from the interaction between a highly dipolar molecule with a selectively directed highly
                  polarizable 1-nm gold particle. With this approach, a second harmonic signal, which is enhanced by the nanoparticle, is detected
                  from a volume of nanometric dimensions. This present work clearly shows that functional cellular imaging around single molecules
                  is possible by selectively directing an antibody with a 1-nm gold label to a specific membrane protein. The results of this
                  work open the way for three-dimensional, high resolution functional imaging of membrane electrophysiology in cells and cellular
                  networks.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_pen01">We have investigated the impact of steric effects on the hybridization and enzymatic extension of oligonucleotides bound to
                  12-nm colloidal Au particles. In these experiments, a nanoparticle-bound 12-mer sequence is hybridized either to its solution
                  phase 12-mer complement or to an 88-mer template sequence. The particle-bound oligonucleotide serves as a primer for enzymatic
                  extension reactions, in which covalent incorporation of nucleotides to form the complement of the template is achieved by
                  the action of DNA polymerase. Primers were attached via-C6H12SH, -C12H24SH, and -TTACAATC6H12SH linkers attached at the 5'
                  end. Primer coverage on the nanoparticles was varied by dilution with 5'HSC6H12AAA AAA3'. Hybridization efficiencies were
                  determined as a function of linker length, primer coverage, complement length (12-mer vs 88-mer), and primer:complement concentration
                  ratio. In all cases, hybridization for the 88-mer was less efficient than for the 12-mer. Low primer surface coverages, greater
                  particle-primer separation, and higher primer:complement ratios led to optimal hybridization. Hybridization efficiencies as
                  high as 98% and 75% were observed for the 12-mer and 88-mer, respectively. Enzymatic extension of particle-bound primers was
                  observed under all conditions tested; however, the efficiency of the reaction was strongly affected by linker length and primer
                  coverage. Extension of primers attached by the longest linker was as efficient as the solution-phase reaction.

                  broadening of the surface plasmon line. A similar behavior is observed for resonant excitation of the surface plasmon. This
                  broadening is the dominant optical nonlinearity of the system, and reflects the excitation-induced damping of the surface
                  plasmon resonance. The time evolution of the damping rate follows that of the electronic scattering rate.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_phi96">Stretched exponential relaxation, exp[?(t /tau)^beta], fits many relaxation processes in disordered and quenched electronic
                  and molecular systems, but it is widely believed that this function has no microscopic basis, especially in the case of molecular
                  relaxation. For electronic relaxation the appearance of the stretched exponential is often described in the context of dispersive
                  transport, where beta iis treated as an adjustable parameter, but in almost all cases it is generally assumed that no microscopic
                  meaning can be assigned to 0 &lt; beta(T) &lt; 1 even at T = Tg, a glass transition temperature. We show that for molecular relaxation
                  beta(Tg) can be understood, providing that one separates extrinsic and intrinsic effects, and that the intrinsic effects are
                  dominated by two magic numbers, beta_SR = 3/5 for short-range forces, and beta_K = 3/7 for long-range Coulomb forces, as originally
                  observed by Kohlrausch for the decay of residual charge on a Leyden jar. Our mathematical model treats relaxation kinetics
                  using the Lifshitz? Kac?Luttinger diffusion to traps depletion model in a configuration space of effective dimensionality,
                  the latter being determined using axiomatic set theory and Phillips?Thorpe constraint theory. The experiments discussed include
                  ns neutron scattering experiments, particularly those based on neutron spin echoes which measure S(Q, t) directly, and the
                  traditional linear response measurements which span the range from Âµs to s, as collected and analysed phenomenologically by
                  Angell, Ngai, BÂ¨ohmer and others. The electronic materials discussed include a-Si:H, granular C60, semiconductor nanocrystallites,
                  charge density waves in TaS3, spin glasses, and vortex glasses in high-temperature semiconductors. The molecular materials
                  discussed include polymers, network glasses, electrolytes and alcohols, Van der Waals supercooled liquids and glasses, orientational
                  glasses, water, fused salts, and heme proteins. In the intrinsic cases the theory of beta(Tg) is often accurate to 2%, which
                  is often better than the quoted experimental accuracies Â 5%. The extrinsic cases are identified by explicit structural signatures
                  which are discussed at length. The discussion also includes recent molecular dynamical simulations for metallic glasses, spin
                  glasses, quasicrystals and polymers which have achieved the intermediate relaxed Kohlrausch state and which have obtained
                  values of beta in excellent agreement with the prediction of the microscopic theory.

                  dye parallel to a silver surface and nonresonant interaction, maximum energy transfer to plasmon surface polaritons was observed
                  for a molecule-silver spacing of about 18 nm. Reducing the spacing results in a monotonic decrease of the coupling efficiency:
                  this decay channel becomes unimportant and eventually vanishes if the molecule is placed very close to the metal surface.
                  The experimental results are discussed in connection with theoretical predictions and the surface-enhanced Raman scattering
                  observed for some adsorbates at metal surfaces.

                  of plasmon excitations in the ?hot? spots, where the local field can exceed the applied field by several orders of magnitude.
                  The high local fields of the localized fractal modes result in dramatic enhancement of optical responses, making feasible

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_pus06a">We study finite-size effects in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) from molecules adsorbed on small metal particles.
                  Within an electromagnetic description of SERS, the enhancement of the Raman signal originates from the local field of the
                  surface plasmon resonance in a nanoparticle. With decreasing particle sizes, this enhancement is reduced due to the size-dependent
                  Landau damping of the surface plasmon. We show that, in small noble-metal particles, the reduction of interband screening
                  in the surface layer leads to an additional increase in the local field acting on a molecule close to the metal surface. The
                  overall size dependence of Raman signal enhancement is determined by the interplay between Landau damping and underscreening
                  effects. Our calculations, based on a two-region model, show that the role of the surface layer increases for smaller nanoparticle
                  sizes due to a larger volume fraction of the underscreened region.

                  developed. For nanoparticle sizes smaller than 10 nm, the classical electromagnetic enhancement mechanism is modified by quantum-size
                  effects. Using time-dependent local field approximation, we perform systematic analysis of SERS in nanometer-sized Ag nanoparticles.
                  We find that, in small nanoparticles, Raman cross-section enhancement is governed by the interplay between Landau damping

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_ran04">We present optical investigations on the conformation of oligonucleotide layers on Au surfaces. Our studies concentrate on
                  the effect of varying surface coverage densities on the structural properties of layers of 12- and 24mer single-stranded DNA,
                  tethered to the Au surface at one end while being labeled with a fluorescent marker at the opposing end. The distance-dependent
                  energy transfer from the marker dye to the metal surface, which causes quenching of the observed fluorescence, is used to
                  provide information on the orientation of the DNA strands relative to the surface. Variations in the oligonucleotide coverage
                  density, as determined from electrochemical quantification, over 2 orders of magnitude are achieved by employing different
                  preparation conditions. The observed enhancement in fluorescence intensity with increasing DNA coverage can be related to
                  a model involving mutual steric interactions of oligonucleotides on the surface, as well as fluorescence quenching theory.
                  Finally, the applicability of the presented concepts for investigations of heterogeneous monolayers is demonstrated by means
                  of studying the coadsorption of mercaptohexanol onto DNA-modified Au surfaces.

                  biotin. Addition of streptavidin and subsequent specific binding events alter the dielectric environment of the nanoparticle,
                  resulting in a spectral shift of the particle plasmon resonance. As we use single nanoparticles showing a homogeneous scattering

                  been described using extended Mie calculations and compared with the experimental findings. The fluorescence of ss-DNA increases
                  by a factor of 100 when it binds to a complimentary DNA while the addition of single-base mismatch DNA had no effect on the

                  films. The theoretical model we employ for the metallic particle is simply that of N free electrons trapped by an infinitely
                  deep spherical potential well. The model used for the thin-film problem is that of a system of free electrons constrained
                  to move in the volume enclosed by two infinite parallel planes. Linear-response theory and Poisson's equation are used to
                  calculate the electronic polarizability in terms of the electronic density-density response function. The numerical results
                  provide an idea of just how small, or how thin, a small metallic particle, or thin metallic film, has to be for it to begin
                  to lose its bulk property of being able to screen an externally applied electric field.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_rie97">Single-molecule atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the mechanical properties of titin, the giant sarcomeric
                  protein of striated muscle. Individual titin molecules were repeatedly stretched, and the applied force was recorded as a
                  function of the elongation. At large extensions, the restoring force exhibited a sawtoothlike pattern, with a periodicity
                  that varied between 25 and 28 nanometers. Measurements of recombinant titin immunoglobulin segments of two different lengths
                  exhibited the same pattern and allowed attribution of the discontinuities to the unfolding of individual immunoglobulin domains.
                  The forces required to unfold individual domains ranged from 150 to 300 piconewtons and depended on the pulling speed. Upon
                  relaxation, refolding of immunoglobulin domains was observed.

                  linker protein. Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy of the coupled-particle plasmon allows us to compare the inter-nanoparticle
                  distance of individual protein-linked gold nanoparticle dimers before and after surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).
                  We find that low-intensity (50 W/m2) laser light in resonance with the nanoparticle-dimer plasmon provokes a change of the
                  inter-nanoparticle distance on the order of 0.5 nm whenever SERS from the proteins connecting the nanoparticles can be observed.

                  proper polarization. The strongly enhanced electric field at the metal tip ( Â  15 nm end diameter) results in a localized
                  excitation source for molecular fluorescence. Excitation of the sample via two-photon absorption provides good image contrast
                  due to the quadratic intensity dependence. The spatial resolution is shown to be better than that of the conventional aperture
                  technique. We used the technique to image fragments of photosynthetic membranes, as well as J-aggregates with spatial resolutions
                  on the order of 20 nm.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_sar05">The adsorption of 2-amino-4-methylbenzothiazole (2-AMBT) on colloidal silver particles has been investigated by a surface
                  enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) study. The SERS spectra of the 2-AMBT molecule at varied adsorbate concentrations recorded
                  in different time domains are compared with its Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum and normal Raman spectrum (NRS)
                  in the bulk and in solution. The experimentally observed SERS spectra are compared with the theoretically modeled surface
                  complexes using ab initio restricted Hatree-Fock (RHF) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The most favorable
                  adsorptive sites of the 2-AMBT molecule have been estimated by natural population analysis (NPA) using the above-mentioned
                  high level of theories. The enhancement of the in-plane modes together with the appearance of Ag-N stretching frequency at
                  215 cm-1 indicates that the 2-AMBT molecule is adsorbed on the silver surface through the lone pair electrons of both nitrogen
                  atoms with the molecular plane nearly vertical to the surface.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_sas05">Surface-enhanced resonant Raman scattering (SERRS) spectra of Rhodamine 6G (R6G) were acquired from single (aggregated) Ag
                  colloidal particles that had been incubated with various amounts of R6G (0.1-125 nM). The spectra were investigated in detail
                  and the evidence for a single-molecule-like response was found even for R6G:Ag particle ratios greatly exceeding equimolarity.
                  After a thorough comparison with literature data, it is concluded that it is reasonable to expect a single-molecule-like response
                  even for fairly ?high? R6G concentrations. A series of Raman images are shown and commented on with respect to bulk SERRS
                  measurements. The problem of band assignment of single-molecule spectra of biological species is addressed. Copyright Â© 2005

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_sav64">In attempting to analyze, on digital computers, data from basically continuous physical experiments, numerical methods of
                  performing familiar operations must be developed. The operations of differentiation and filtering are especially important
                  both as an end in themselves, and as a prelude to further treatment of the data. Numerical counterparts of analog devices
                  that perform these operations, such as RC filters, are often considered. However, the method of least squares may be used
                  without additional computational complexity and with considerable improvement in the informotion obtained. The least squares
                  calculations may be carried out in the computer by convolution of the data points with properly chosen sets of integers. These
                  sets of integers and their normalizing factors are described and their use is illustrated in spectroscopic applications. The
                  computer programs required are relatively simple. Two examples are presented as subroutines in the FORTRAN language.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_saw94">We propose a model for porous silicon, an irregular structure obtained by removing some silicon atoms randomly from a perfect
                  silicon crystal. It is shown by using two-dimensional clusters with a tight-binding model that this model exhibits the energy-gap
                  widening and the nonexponential decay of the photoluminescence (PL), which are in good agreement with the observed properties
                  of porous silicon. In this model, the energy-gap widening is due to the localization of eigenstates caused by the randomness
                  of the structure. The distributions in both size and position of the localized eigenstates, i.e., a statistical effect, yield
                  nonexponential PL decay which is describable by the stretched exponential function. A dynamical effect due to electron and
                  hole hopping between the eigenstates explains the observed strong energy dependence of the PL lifetimes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_sch06">We report on the preparation, characterization, and photophysical study of new fluorescent core/shell nanoparticles fabricated
                  by electrostatic layer-by-layer assembly. On the basis of gold cores with a diameter of 13 nm, these nanocolloids possess
                  different fluorescently labeled polymer corona layers at various distances from the surface of the core metal using nonfluorescent
                  polyelectrolytes as spacer layers. UV-visible spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirm that the particle
                  suspensions of fluorescently labeled core/shell nanoparticles are stable at all stages of their construction. Photophysical
                  investigations reveal strongly distance-dependent fluorescence quenching in these particle systems. The contribution of the
                  metal core to this quenching can be assesed precisely after the gentle dissolution of the gold cores by potassium cyanide.
                  The photophysical measurements reveal clearly that the gold nanoparticles decrease the transition probability for radiative
                  transitions.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_sch98">An unprecedented small thioaurite cluster compound (with metallic Au0 core) has been isolated in high yield by decomposition
                  of polymeric Au(I)SG compounds, where GSH is the ubiquitous tripeptide glutathione, N-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine. The Au:SG
                  clusters appear to share the high stability and robustness of their hydrophobic n-alkyl analogues but are highly water soluble.
                  The most abundant cluster produced by these methods can be easily separated from its homologues by gel electrophoresis. Its
                  total molecular weight is ca. 10.4 kDa, and the mass of its strongly bound inorganic core is 5.6 kDa, suggesting the composition
                  Au28(SG)16. This composition is also consistent with the X-ray diffraction pattern of the crystalline molecular solid. Distinct
                  features in the optical absorption spectroscopy are inherently different from either larger clusters or smaller gold cluster
                  compounds. The compound is optically active, as evidenced by circular dichroism in the near-IR, visible, and near-UV regions.
                  The 13C NMR spectra suggest that the bonding environment of the GS-adsorbate is similar to that of the n-alkyl-adsorbate clusters,
                  and the nonsulfhydryl properties are retained. The cluster is thus envisioned as a large metallic-cluster compound with distinctive
                  optical properties encapsulated by a bioactive peptide monolayer.

                  to study the modification of the fluorescence decay rate of an emitter close to a nanoparticle. In our experiment, gold particles
                  with a diameter of 15 nm were attached to single dye molecules via double-stranded DNA of different lengths. Nanoparticle-induced
                  lifetime modification (NPILM) has promise in serving as a nanoscopic ruler for the distance range well beyond 10 nm, which
                  is the upper limit of fluorescence resonant energy transfer (FRET). Furthermore, the simultaneous detection of single nanoparticles
                  and fluorescent molecules presented in this work provides new opportunities for single molecule biophysical studies.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_sei96">Intermolecular static and dynamic fluorescence quenching constants of eight coumarin derivatives by nucleobase derivatives
                  have been determined in aqueous media. One common sequence of the quenching efficiency has been found for the nucleobases.
                  The feasibility of a photoinduced electron transfer reaction for the nucleobase-specific quenching of fluorescent dyes is
                  investigated by the calculation of the standard free energy changes with the Rehm-Weller equation. A complete set of one-electron
                  redox potential data for the nucleobases are determined electrochemically in aprotic solvents for the first time, which are
                  compared with values obtained by various other methods. Depending on the redox properties of the fluorescent dyes, the sequences
                  of the quenching efficiencies can be rationalized by the orders of electrochemical oxidation potentials (vs NHE) of nucleosides
                  (dG (+1.47 V) &lt; dA &lt; dC dT &lt; U (&gt; +2.39 V)) and reduction potentials (dG (&lt; -2.76 V) &lt; dA &lt; dC &lt; dT &lt; U (-2.07 V)). The correlation
                  between the intermolecular dynamic quenching constants and the standard free energy of photoinduced electron transfer according
                  to the classical Marcus equation indicates that photoinduced electron transfer is the rate-limiting step. However, an additional,
                  water-specific gain of free energy between -0.5 and -0.9 eV shows that additional effects, like a coupled proton transfer
                  and a hydrophobic effect, have to be considered, too. Furthermore, the capability of the nucleobases to form ground state
                  complexes with fluorescent dyes is influenced by their redox potentials. The relevance of these observations to current efforts
                  for DNA sequencing with a detection by laser-induced fluorescence and their application to other dyes are discussed.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_sha98">Surface-enhanced optical nonlinearities are studied in a semicontinuous film consisting of metal granules randomly distributed
                  on an insulating substrate. The local fields are very inhomogeneous in such films and consist of strongly localized sharp
                  peaks. In peaks (hot spots), the local fields exceed the applied field by several orders of magnitudes resulting in giant
                  enhancements of the optical nonlinearities. Because of such a pattern for the local field distributions, the nonlinear signals
                  are mostly generated from small nanometer-size areas. The corresponding spatial distributions for the generated fields form,
                  in turn, a set of very sharp peaks on a homogeneous, on average, semicontinuous film. It is shown that the spatial positions
                  of the localized hot spots at the fundamental and generated frequencies are located, in general, in different parts of a film.
                  The local enhancements in the hot spots exceed the average enhancement by several orders of magnitude. The predicted giant
                  local enhancements open fascinating possibilities in nonlinear spectroscopy of single molecules on a semicontinuous metal
                  film. A number of surface-enhanced optical nonlinearities are studied, namely, those that are responsible for the Kerr-effect,
                  four-wave mixing, second-, and third-harmonic generation. The enhancement for nonlinear optical processes is shown to strongly
                  increase toward the long-wavelength part of the spectrum. Spatial distributions of the local fields are calculated in our
                  broad-scale numerical simulations. A scaling theory for the high-order field moments is developed. It predicts that the moments
                  of the local fields are very large and independent of the frequency in a wide spectral range. The theory predicts anomalous
                  field fluctuations and giant enhancements for the nonlinear optical processes, from the visible to the far-infrared spectral
                  range.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_sim74">Presented are the results of studies with 29 positively charged cyanine dyes that fluorimetrically respond to valinomycin-induced
                  changes in the membrane potentials of red blood cell and phospholipid vesicle suspensions. Several of the dyes exhibit fluorescence
                  changes in excess of 80% upon membrane hyperpolarization (inside becomes negative). The fluorescence response of the dyes
                  is shown to result from potentialdependent partition of dye molecules between the cells and the extracellular medium. Cell
                  hyperpolarization results in uptake of the dye molecules by the cells, while depolarization results in release of dye. The
                  emission from cell-associated dye becomes significantly quenched as the amount of cell-associated dye increases. We present
                  evidence that suggests that the quenching of cell-associated dye is due to formation of dye aggregates, which have reduced
                  fluorescence.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_sok98">Fluorescence enhancement was studied on silver colloidal metal films (CMFs) using two systems: (1) Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers
                  of fluorescein-labeled phospholipids separated from the surface of the films by spacer layers of octadecanoic acid and (2)
                  biotin-fluorescein conjugates captured by avidin molecules adsorbed on top of a multilayer structure formed by alternating
                  layers of bovine serum albumin-biotin conjugate (BSA-biotin) and avidin. The dependence of fluorescence intensity on the number
                  of lipid or protein spacer layers deposited on the surface of the CMF was investigated. The results demonstrate the requirement
                  for adsorbate location within the region between Ag particles for maximal enhancement. The density of avidin molecules on
                  the surface of the BSA-biotin/avidin multilayers adsorbed on the CMF was also determined. A procedure for forming a rigid,
                  uniform silica layer around the Ag particles on the CMF is described. The layer protects the particles from undesirable chemical
                  reactions such as etching by halide ions, for example, and provides the requisite stability for bioanalytical applications.
                  Colloidal films composed of Ag particles covered by Â 10-nm-thick silica layers were tested for fluorescence enhancement using
                  goat immunoglobulin and a conjugate of rabbit anti-goat immunoglobulin with 6-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)hexanoate.
                  An enhancement factor of Â 20 was obtained.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_sol07">Gold nanoparticles manipulate the quantum efficiency of phosphorescent molecules, which are attached via biotin-streptavidin
                  recognition at a distance of 4 nm to the nanoparticle surface. Time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy reveals an increase
                  in the radiative as well as in the nonradiative rate of the phosphorescent molecules upon binding to gold nanoparticles. The
                  increase in the radiative rate alone would lead to an increased luminescence quantum yield. However, this effect is outweighed
                  by the distinct enhancement of the nonradiative rate due to energy transfer, resulting in an overall quenching of the luminescence.

                  is red-shifted from that of a single particle because of near-field coupling. It is also found that the shift decays approximately
                  exponentially with increasing particle spacing and become negligible when the gap between the two particles exceeds about

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_tam07a">We present a resonant optical nanoantenna positioned at the end of a metal-coated glass fiber near-field probe. Antenna resonances,
                  excitation conditions, and field localization are directly probed in the near field by single fluorescent molecules and compared
                  to finite integration technique simulations. It is shown that the antenna is equivalent to its radio frequency analogue, the
                  monopole antenna. For the right antenna length and local excitation conditions, antenna resonances occur that lead to an enhanced
                  localized field near the antenna apex. Direct mapping of this field with single fluorescent molecules reveals a spatial localization
                  of 25 nm, demonstrating the importance of such antennas for nanometer resolution optical microscopy.

                  Applying a short-pulse diode laser emitting at 635 nm with a repetition rate of 64 MHz we studied the time-resolved identification
                  of individual carbocyanine and oxazine dyes via their characteristic fluorescence lifetimes of 2.06Â±0.37 ns (Cy5) and 3.89Â±0.91

                  time resolution. These jumps exhibit short off-states off of 0.5 ms which can be ascribed to the triplet state lifetime under
                  dry conditions with an intersystem crossing yield YISC of 0.2 other quantum jumps into longer lived states (several milliseconds)
                  with lower transition probability were observed. The correlation of rotational and spectral jumps of single and coupled fluorophores

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_tin01">A new scanning technique for simultaneous recording of intensity, fluorescence lifetime, and spectral information with single
                  molecule sensitivity is presented. We investigated and compared the photophysical parameters of single oxazine (JA242), rhodamine
                  (JF9), and carbocyanine (Cy5) derivatives adsorbed on glass surfaces under air-equilibrated conditions. The obtained results
                  demonstrate that spectrally resolved fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (SFLIM) is ideally suited to reveal subpopulations
                  in inhomogeneous samples and mixtures. To obtain a more detailed insight into the underlying fluorescence dynamics of single
                  molecules, the fluorescence characteristics of the three different chromophores were studied positioning isolated molecules
                  in the laser focus. Two detectors with two PC plug-in cards for time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) were utilized
                  to monitor fluorescence intensity, lifetime, and spectral information simultaneously with single-molecule sensitivity and
                  microseconds to milliseconds time resolution. Discrete jumps in fluorescence intensity from single molecules which lacked
                  spectral diffusion and changes in radiative lifetime have been observed with correlation times (triplet lifetimes) spanning
                  several orders of magnitude (from 2 s for the rhodamine derivative up to several seconds for the oxazine dye) and amplitude.
                  For the carbocyanine derivative Cy5, fast spectral fluctuations to red-shifted dim-states which appear partly as off-states
                  with a lifetime in the millisecond range were determined. In addition, these dim-states exhibit the same radiative decay rate
                  of Â 2 ns as the normal on-state. Our results imply that a direct correlation between the radiative decay time and spectral
                  fluctuations is not necessarily given in each of the three chromophores. Both parameters seem to be independent characteristic
                  of each individual molecule. About 5-15 structure, respectively, exhibited a constant emission spectrum but strong fluctuations
                  in fluorescence lifetime directly correlated to the intensity. The results indicate that a combined analysis of emission spectrum,
                  intensity and radiative decay rate is a valuable approach for classification and quantification of the underlying photophysical
                  dynamics.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_tor98">Raman spectra of anhydrous complexes of streptavidin (Strep) with biotin (Bio) and some Bio analogues [Biotin methyl ester
                  (MEBio), desthiobiotin (DEBio), 2?-iminobiotin (IMBio), and diaminobiotin (DABio)] were recorded. The vibrational results
                  indicate that the interaction with some of these ligands is able to modify the overall structure of the protein and this binding
                  results in a decrease in the &amp;bgr;sheet content and an increase in the &amp;agr;-helix content. To further confirm the conformational
                  changes of the protein structure due to Bio analogue binding, the curve-fitting analysis of the amide I Raman band of neat
                  Strep and of the complexes were performed. The intensity ratio of the components due to the &amp;bgr;-sheet and &amp;agr;-helix conformations
                  decreased in the Strep-MEBio, Strep-IMBio (pH 11), and Strep-Bio systems, whereas in all the other systems the changes were
                  not significant. This behavior differs from that of Avi bound to the same ligands and suggests that Strep and Avi differ in
                  their binding selectivity. A good correlation was found between the secondary structure percentages of the Avi and of the
                  Strep complexes and &amp;Dgr;GÂ°. On the basis of this linear relationship, the vibrational results allow for an acceptable evaluation
                  of the dissociation constants of the Strep complexes, not previously reported in the literature. The present results indicate
                  a correlation between the type of interaction and the effects of the protein-substrate bonding on the overall structure of
                  the proteins. The amino acid residues in the binding site appear to be positioned in a such a way as to provide a precise
                  fit of Bio. Even slight change in the substrate structure causes a weakness in the strength of the binding. The vibrational
                  results confirm that both the imidazolidinone and the thiophan rings are important in the Strep-Bio interactions, but the
                  former is more responsible for the high affinity of the binding. One of the Tyr residues is hydrogen bound with the ureido
                  ring and another Tyr could be involved in the binding pocket. Trp residues do not directly bind the ligand and probably stabilize
                  other binding site residues which in turn interact directly with Bio.

                  atomic force microscopy tip with respect to the molecule. We observe a decrease of the excited state lifetime and the fluorescence
                  rate when the tip apex is in close proximity to the molecule. These effects are attributed to the fact that the dielectric
                  tip converts non-propagating near-fields to propagating fields within the dielectric tip effectively quenching the fluorescence.
                  The spatial extension of the quenching area is of subwavelength dimensions. The results are discussed in terms of molecular
                  fluorescence in a system of stratified media. The experiment provides surprising new insights into the interactions between
                  a fluorescent molecule and a dielectric tip. The methodology holds promise for applications in ultra high-resolution near-field

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_tsk97">The giant muscle protein titin, also called connectin, is responsible for the elasticity of relaxed striated muscle, as well
                  as acting as the molecular scaffold for thick-filament formation1,2. The titin molecule consists largely of tandem domains
                  of the immuno-globulin and fibronectin-III types, together with specialized binding regions and a putative elastic region,
                  the PEVK domain3. We have done mechanical experiments on single molecules of titin to determine their visco-elastic properties,
                  using an optical-tweezers technique. On a fast (0.ls) timescale titin is elastic and force-extension data can be fitted with
                  standard random-coil polymer models, showing that there are two main sources of elasticity: one deriving from the entropy
                  of straightening the molecule; the other consistent with extension of the polypeptide chain in the PEVK region. On a slower
                  timescale and above a certain force threshold, the molecule displays stress-relaxation, which occurs in rapid steps of a few
                  piconewtons, corresponding to yielding of internal structures by about 20 nm. This stress-relaxation probably derives from
                  unfolding of immu-noglobulin and fibronectin domains.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_tur51">After a preliminary survey with the electron microscope of various preparations of colloidal gold, a study was made of the
                  process of nucleation and growth in gold colloids. It was shown that nucleating agents may be identified with reducing agents
                  which form a mixed polymer with chlorauric ion before the reduction to the nucleus takes place. It was also shown that the
                  law of growth is exponential. The average size, the deviation from the average size and the character of the particle size
                  distribution curve are determined by the amount of gold, the nucleation process and the law of growth.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_wab05">This paper describes the use of plasmonics-based nanoprobes that act as molecular sentinels for DNA diagnostics. The plasmonics
                  nanoprobe comprises a metal nanoparticle and a stem-loop DNA molecule tagged with a Raman label. The nanoprobe utilizes the
                  specificity and selectivity of the DNA hairpin probe sequence to detect a specific target DNA sequence of interest. In the
                  absence of target DNA, the stem-loop configuration maintains the Raman label in proximity to the metal nanoparticle, inducing
                  an intense surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect that produces a strong Raman signal upon laser excitation. Upon
                  hybridization of a complementary target DNA sequence to the nanoprobe, the stem-loop configuration is disrupted, causing the
                  Raman label to physically separate from the metal nanoparticle, thus quenching the SERS signal. The usefulness and potential
                  application of the plasmonics nanoprobe for diagnosis is demonstrated using the gag gene sequence of the human immunodeficiency
                  virus type 1 (HIV-1). We successfully demonstrated the specificity and selectivity of the plasmonics nanoprobes to detect
                  PCR amplicons of the HIV gene. The potential for combining the spectral selectivity and high sensitivity of the SERS process
                  with inherent molecular specificity of DNA hairpins to diagnose molecular target sequences in homogeneous solutions is discussed.

                  acceptors is studied by changing the ion concentration in buffered aqueous solutions, by changing the concentration of acceptors,

                  MPC monolayers and by galvanic exchange of metal atoms on the MPC core surface with different metals. The observed emissions
                  are believed to result from surface-localized states that depend on both the core metal of the nanoparticle and the ligands

                  that require the formation of an irreversible and specific linkage between biological macromolecules. Comparison of the refined
                  crystal structures of apo and a streptavidin:biotin complex shows that the high affinity results from several factors. These
                  factors include the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions between biotin and the protein, together
                  with the ordering of surface polypeptide loops that bury the biotin in the protein interior. Structural alterations at the
                  biotin binding site produce quaternary changes in the streptavidin tetramer. These changes apparently propagate through cooperative
                  deformations in the twisted beta sheets that link tetramer subunits.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_wen97">Measurement of fluorescent lifetimes of dye-tagged DNA molecules reveal the existence of different conformations. Conformational
                  fluctuations observed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy give rise to a relaxation behavior that is described by "stretched"
                  exponentials and indicates the presence of a distribution of transition rates between two conformations. Whether this is an
                  inhomogeneous distribution, where each molecule contributes with its own reaction rate to the overall distribution, or a homogeneous
                  distribution, where the reaction rate of each molecule is time-dependent, is not yet known. We used a tetramethylrhodamine-linked
                  217-bp DNA oligonucleotide as a probe for conformational fluctuations. Fluorescence fluctuations from single DNA molecules
                  attached to a streptavidin-coated surface directly show the transitions between two conformational states. The conformational
                  fluctuations typical for single molecules are similar to those seen in single ion channels in cell membranes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_wid00">Cy5 is one of a few commercially available dyes in the near-infrared wavelength range. In this study, the fluorescence fluctuations
                  of Cy5 have been investigated under steady-state excitation conditions by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). The
                  fluctuations in fluorescence are compatible with and can be used to characterize the photoinduced isomerization and back-isomerization,
                  as well as the transitions between the singlet and triplet states of the dye. By employing a simple kinetic model, the rate
                  constants of these processes can be determined. The model was used over a broad range of experimental conditions, where the
                  influence on the isomerization properties of solvent viscosity, polarity, and temperature, excitation intensity and wavelength,
                  and the presence of different side groups was investigated. We propose FCS as a useful and simple complementary approach to
                  study isomerization processes of cyanine dyes yielding information about the rates of both the photoinduced isomerization
                  and the back-isomerization, as well as of the kinetic properties of the triplet states. Our data show that for most excitation
                  conditions relevant for ultrasensitive fluorescence spectroscopy a photostationary equilibrium is established between the
                  isomeric forms, where approximately 50 molecules can be expected to be in their weakly fluorescent cis states. The fluorophores
                  therefore lose about half of their fluorescence capacity. This is of relevance for the performance of the dye in all applications
                  of fluorescence spectroscopy where a high sensitivity or a fast readout is required, such as in single-molecule detection
                  experiments and in many applications of confocal laser scanning microscopy.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_wri98">Mie scattering is an important tool for diagnosing microparticles or aerosol particles in technical or natural environments.
                  Mie theory is restricted to spherical, homogeneous, isotropic and non-magnetic particles in a non-absorbing medium. However,
                  as microparticles are hardly ever spherical or homogeneous, there is much interest in more advanced scattering theories. During
                  recent decades, scattering methods for non-spherical and non-homogeneous particles have been developed and even some computer
                  codes are readily available. Extension of Mie theory covers coated spheres, stratified spheres and clustered spheres. For
                  homogeneous non-spherical particles such as spheroids, ellipsoids and finite cylinders, surface discretization methods have
                  been developed. Scattering by inhomogeneous particles may be computed by volume discretization methods.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_wue99">We describe the use of the Taylor dispersion method to determine the diffusion coefficients of monolayer protected clusters
                  (MPCs). The MPCs have nanometer Au cores (Â 1-5 nm diameter) coated with a passivating, self-assembled monolayer of thiolate
                  ligands (Â 40-600). The results are found to agree with electrochemically measured diffusion coefficients, validating both
                  approaches for measuring nanoparticle diffusivities. Taylor diffusion coefficients are used to calculate MPC hydrodynamic
                  diameters under the sticking and the slip boundary conditions of the Stokes-Einstein equation, which are compared to the overall
                  MPC diameter-estimated as the core diameter (measured by TEM) plus the length (2L) of two fully extended ligands. Better agreement
                  between calculated and experimental hydrodynamic diameters of alkanethiolate-coated MPCs in organic solvents are obtained
                  using slip boundary conditions, implying free draining of solvent through the outer portion of the extended chains. The hard-sphere
                  (sticking) version of the Stokes-Einstein relation predicts unrealistically small hydrodynamic diameters. Similar but less
                  clear-cut results are obtained for tiopronin-coated MPC ions in aqueous media.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_xuh00">We examine whether single molecule sensitivity in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) can be explained in the framework
                  of classical electromagnetic theory. The influence of colloid particle shape and size, composition (Ag or Au) and interparticle
                  separation distance on the wavelength-dependent SERS enhancement factor is reported. Our calculations indicate that the maximum
                  enhancement factor achievable through electromagnetics is of the order 1011. This is obtained only under special circumstances,
                  namely at interstitial sites between particles and at locations outside sharp surface protrusions. The comparative rarity
                  of such sites, together with the extreme spatial localization of the enhancement they provide, can qualitatively explain why
                  only very few surface sites seem to contribute to the measured signal in single-molecule SERS experiments. Enhancement factors
                  of the order 1014-1015, which have been reported in recent experiments, are likely to involve additional enhancement mechanisms
                  such as chemisorption induced resonance Raman effects.

                  of the total scattered far field based on an asymptotic form of vector translational addition theorems. With this asymptotic
                  expansion of the far field, we derive analytical expressions for the scattering properties of an arbitrary aggregate of spheres.
                  Resulting formulas are free from numerical problems in practical applications. Theoretical predictions from this far-field

                  (DDA) for two-sphere aggregates. We also compare theoretical predictions with laboratory scattering measurements to examine
                  the validity of the numerical solutions. It is found that there are cases in which the DDA solution, while satisfying the
                  validity criterion for interdipole spacing to be small compared with the wavelength of incident radiation, deviates significantly
                  from the rigorous solution and the experimental results. We show that the DDA works reasonably well for small-volume structures
                  and that its validity is challenged, at least as it is currently implemented, when used on larger structures. We also show
                  that, besides its advantages in reliability, the rigorous solution approach is far superior to the approximation method in
                  computing efficiency as well.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_yan03">Stable undecagold clusters were synthesized and protected with a monolayer of alkanethiolates. The particles were found to
                  exhibit semiconductor electronic characteristics with a band gap of about 1.8 eV, as evaluated from voltammetric and spectroscopic
                  measurements. Photoluminescence in the visible range was also observed from the peak position at 840 nm. The indirect band-gap
                  characteristics indicate that there exist substantial surface trap states in the nanoparticle molecules. Prior to exchange
                  reactions with alkanethiols, however, no luminescence was observed with the gold particles, Au11Cl3(PPh3)7. This was interpreted,
                  at least in part, by the effect of ligand fields on the electronic (band-gap) energy splitting and the resulting electron
                  distributions. These observations strongly suggest that surface chemistry plays a vital role in determining the electronic
                  energy structure of these subnanometer-sized gold particles.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_ygu01">We have developed a new detection technology that uses resonance light scattering (RLS) particles as labels for analyte detection
                  in a wide range of formats including immuno and DNA probe type of assays in solution, solid phase, cells, and tissues. When
                  a suspension of nano sized gold or silver particles is illuminated with a fine beam of white light, the scattered light has
                  a clear (not cloudy) color that depends on composition and particle size. This scattered light can be used as the signal for
                  ultrasensitive analyte detection. The advantages of gold particles as detection labels are that (a) their light producing
                  power is equivalent to more than 500,000 fluorescein molecules, (b) they can be detected at concentrations as low as 10-15
                  M in suspension by eye and a simple illuminator, (c) they do not photobleach, (d) individual particles can be seen in a simple
                  student microscope with dark field illumination, (e) color of scattered light can be changed by changing particle size or
                  composition for multicolor multiplexing, and (f) they can be conjugated with antibodies, DNA probes, ligands, and protein
                  receptors for specific analyte detection. These advantages allow for ultra-senstive analyte detection with easiness of use
                  and simple and relatively inexpensive instrumentation. We have shown that our RLS technology can indeed be used for ultra-sensitive
                  detection in a wide range of applications including immuno and DNA probe assays in solution and solid phases, detection of
                  cell surface components and in situ hybridization in cells and tissues. Most of the assay formats described in this article
                  can be adapted for drug fast throughput screening.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_zan01">Colloidal nanocrystal/DNA conjugates hold the promise of becoming powerful probes for biological diagnostics as well as versatile
                  building blocks for nanotechnology. To fully realize this potential, it is important to precisely control the number of oligonucleotides
                  bound to the nanocrystal. Here we demonstrate electrophoretic isolation of 5 and 10 nm gold nanocrystals bearing discrete
                  numbers of single-stranded DNA (1-5). The potential use of these discrete conjugates in the fabrication of novel nanostructures
                  is discussed.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_zan02">Discrete Au nanoparticle/DNA conjugates have been isolated by electrophoresis and used to form small groupings of particles,
                  such as dimers and trimers. The use of purified conjugates leads to a higher yield of the target structure, and it has allowed
                  us better control and understanding of the system. Newly accessible questions, such as the electrophoretic mobility of nanoparticle/DNA
                  hybrids and the critical role of particle surface charge on mobility, have been studied. Detailed characterization by transmission
                  electron microscopy (TEM) has now been done because of the higher quality of the samples. A computer program to generate pair
                  distribution functions from TEM images was developed, pointing out the dependence of interparticle distance with DNA length
                  on dimers of particles.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_zha06">N-(2-Mercaptopropionyl)glycine (tiopronin)-coated silver nanoparticles (average diameter of metal core = 5 nm) were prepared
                  by a modified Brust method. Tiopronin ligands were partially displaced by thiolate single-stranded oligonucleotides via ligand
                  exchange. These particles were immobilized onto a solid substrate through hybridization with target oligonucleotides in a
                  layer-by-layer approach. The dye-labeled complementary oligonucleotides were bound to the particle layers through hybridization.
                  Fluorescence intensity was enhanced with a simultaneous increase of plasmon absorbance from accumulated particles. A steady
                  state was shown at the 10th particle layer and then the fluorescence enhancement showed a plateau. This result reveals that
                  increasing the particle layer contributes to fluorescence enhancement. This novel method was used to detect DNA hybridization
                  through both absorbance and emission spectral changes.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_zha06a">In this work we present a detailed time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) investigation of the absorption and Raman
                  spectra of a pyrazine molecule located at the junction between two Ag20 clusters. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering enhancements
                  of the order of $10^6$ have been found for the junction system, which are similar to enhancements of $10^5$ found for individual
                  silver nanoparticles. Surprisingly, the chemical enhancement is found to account for as much as $10^5$, suggesting that this
                  mechanism might be more important than previously believed, in particular for nanoparticle aggregates. Moreover, TDDFT calculations
                  suggest that unlike larger nanoparticles, the junction between small Ag20 tetrahedral clusters does not provide an electromagnetic
                  "hot spot".

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_zha07">We prepared silver particle dimers with single Cy5 molecules localized between coupled metal particles. The silver particles
                  with a 20 nm diameter were chemically bound with single-stranded oligonucleotides. The dimers were formed by hybridization
                  with double-length single-stranded oligonucleotides that contained single Cy5 molecules. The image analysis revealed that
                  the single-molecule fluorescence was enhanced 7-fold on the metal monomer and 13-fold on the metal dimer relative to the free
                  Cy5-labeled oligonucleotide in the absence of metal. The lifetimes were shortened on the silver monomers and further shortened
                  on the silver dimers, demonstrating the near-field interaction mechanism of fluorophore with the metal substrate. Finite-difference
                  time-domain (FDTD) calculations were employed to study the distribution of electric field near the metal monomer and dimer.
                  The coupling effect of metal particle on the fluorescence enhancement was discussed.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_zhu03">Surface modification of citrate-reduced gold nanoparticles with 2-mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA) was carried out in the aqueous

                  of the protecting MSA layer on the behavior of the modified gold nanoparticles in comparison with that of the traditional
                  citrate-reduced gold colloid was evaluated by HCl titration, cyanide etching, and seeded growth tests. The modified gold nanoparticles
                  show an improved stability against pH changes and cyanide etching. They do show further growth, which appears to be more homogeneous
                  than for the unmodified particles.

               <p class="abstract" style="display:none" id="abstract_no-group_zoc03">We have measured the temperature driven denaturing, or melting transition in poly d(A)-poly d(T) DNA oligomers of various
                  lengths in different buffer conditions. Our findings are in clear disagreement with two state, reaction kinetics model, and
                  we find that the so-called zipper model, where denaturing proceeds through opening of the duplex at the ends describes well
                  the temperature dependence of the average number of open base pairs. Analysis of the length dependence of the transition parameters
                  however suggest that bubble formation is important and that the transition, in the thermodynamic limit, is continuous, albeit
                  close to first order.
