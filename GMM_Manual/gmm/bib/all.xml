      <abstract>A gel-diffusion technique in which transport occurs across a thin agar membrane has been devised. This technique was used for pore-size calibration of a series of agar gels of various concentrations by measurement of hindrance to diffusion of human hemoglobin and southern bean mosaic virus particles. Pore radii calculated from independent restricted diffusion measurements of these two particle-species by use of a theoretical equation of were in very good agreement, and show that this equation provides a close approximation to the diffusional restriction occurring in these systems. Values of restricted diffusion coefficients in gels of various pore sizes were obtained from restricted diffusion measurements of four other proteins (rabbit [gamma]-globulin, human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, and pancreatic ribonuclease). When these coefficients were extrapolated to conditions of infinite pore size (zero gel concentration) the values obtained agreed generally with reported values of the free diffusion coefficients for these proteins. Sharp differentiation in diffusional restriction on the basis of particle size and shape was demonstrated.</abstract>

      <abstract>Surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectroscopy has been used to assess protein-metal interactions in colloidal immunoprobes. The absence of a detectable signal from conjugates of colloidal gold with antirabbit IgG, albumin-biotin, or protein A suggests that the proteins are not chemisorbed on the metal particles. Similarly, albumin, albumin-biotin, and protein A are not covalently bound to colloidal silver, but rather adsorb on silver initially with the protein hydration shell intact. Over a period of days, new SER bands appear in the albumin spectrum that are attributed to vibrations of aromatic amino acids. This implies that conformational changes are occurring in the protein near the interface. The time scale for these changes is consistent with what has been observed by circular dichroism and UV-visible spectroscopy. The effect of avidin on the binding of biotin to colloidal metal probes has also been characterized. The SERS results indicate that biotin binds to a cleft or pocketlike structure in avidin, restricting biotin-surface interactions. This study demonstrates the utility of SER spectroscopy for characterizing protein-metal interactions and the availability of adsorbed biomolecules for complexation.</abstract>

      <abstract>Patterning matter on the nanometre scale is an important objective of current materials chemistry and physics. It is driven by both the need to further miniaturize electronic components and the fact that at the nanometre scale, materials properties are strongly size-dependent and thus can be tuned sensitively1. In nanoscale crystals, quantum size effects and the large number of surface atoms influence the, chemical, electronic, magnetic and optical behaviour2?4. 'Top-down' (for example, lithographic) methods for nanoscale manipulation reach only to the upper end of the nanometre regime5; but whereas 'bottom-up' wet chemical techniques allow for the preparation of mono-disperse, defect-free crystallites just 1?10 nm in size6?10, ways to control the structure of nanocrystal assemblies are scarce. Here we describe a strategy for the synthesis of'nanocrystal molecules', in which discrete numbers of gold nanocrystals are organized into spatially defined structures based on Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions. We attach single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides of defined length and sequence to individual nanocrystals, and these assemble into dimers and trimers on addition of a complementary single-stranded DNA template. We anticipate that this approach should allow the construction of more complex two-and three-dimensional assemblies.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this work, the role of nanoparticle surface charge in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is examined for the common case of measurements made in colloidal solutions of Ag and Au. Average SERS intensities obtained for several analytes (salicylic acid, pyridine, and 2-naphthalenethiol) on Ag and An colloids are correlated with the pH and zeta potential (xi) values of the nanoparticle solutions from which they were recorded. The consequence of the electrostatic interaction between the analyte and the metallic nanoparticle is stressed. The xi potentials of three commonly used colloidal solutions are reported as a function of pH, and a discussion is given on how these influence SERS intensity. Also examined is the importance of nanoparticle aggregation (and colloidal solution collapse) in determining SERS intensities, and how this varies with the pH of the solution. The results show that SERS enhancement is highest at xi potential values where the colloidal nanoparticle solutions are most stable and where the electrostatic repulsion between the particles and the analyte molecules is minimized. These results suggest some important criteria for consideration in all SERS measurements and also provide important insights into the problem of predicting SERS activities for different molecular systems.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present a model to evaluate the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of electronic excited states of a molecule close to a metal particle of complex shape and, possibly, in the presence of a solvent. The molecule is treated quantum mechanically at Hartree?Fock (HF) or density-functional theory (DFT) level. The metal/solvent is considered as a continuous body, characterized by its frequency dependent local dielectric constant. For simple metal shapes (planar infinite surface and spherical particle) a version of the polarizable continuum model based on the integral equation formalism has been used, while an alternative methodology has been implemented to treat metal particles of arbitrary shape. In both cases, equations have been numerically solved using a boundary element method. Excitation energies and nonradiative decay rates due to the energy transfer from the molecule to the metal are evaluated exploiting the linear response theory (TDHF or TDDFT where TD?time dependent). The radiative decay rate of the whole system (molecule+metal/solvent) is calculated, still using a continuum model, in terms of the response of the surrounding to the molecular transition. The model presented has been applied to the study of the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of a lissamine molecule in solution (water) and close to gold spherical nanoparticles of different radius. In addition, the influence of the metal shape has been analyzed by performing calculations on a system composed by a coumarin-type molecule close to silver aggregates of complex shape.</abstract>

      <abstract>By studying the transfer of excitation energy between dye molecules confined within an optical microcavity, we demonstrate experimentally that Förster energy transfer is influenced by the local photonic mode density. Locating donor and acceptor molecules at well-defined positions allows the transfer rate to be determined as a function of both mutual separation and cavity length. The results show that the Förster transfer rate depends linearly on the donor emission rate and hence photonic mode density, providing the potential to control energy transfer by modification of the optical environment.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present an experimental and theoretical study of the fluorescence rate of a single molecule as a function of its distance to a laser-irradiated gold nanoparticle. The local field enhancement leads to an increased excitation rate whereas nonradiative energy transfer to the particle leads to a decrease of the quantum yield (quenching). Because of these competing effects, previous experiments showed either fluorescence enhancement or fluorescence quenching. By varying the distance between molecule and particle we show the first experimental measurement demonstrating the continuous transition from fluorescence enhancement to fluorescence quenching. This transition cannot be explained by treating the particle as a polarizable sphere in the dipole approximation.</abstract>

      <abstract>We derive, in the quasistatic limit, general formulas for the electromagnetic response of a small metal sphere. The jellium model is assumed but we show how corrections, to the classical situation due to tue non-local response with a smoothly varying surface profile can be included in a simple manner. These corrections enter as two lengths, which are measures of the non-locality range. As an example we study the interaction between a dipole and the metal sphere, in the context of image field enhancement and damping because of electron -hole pair excitations in the particle.</abstract>

      <abstract>The non-local response of an irradiated metal surface is discussed in terms of the induced density in response to an external field. The field and the induced charge near the surface can be determined by solving Maxwell's equations in the surface region and match the solution to the incoming and reflected wave in vacuum and to the asymptotic solution in the bulk of the solid. For incoming fields of wave lengths long in comparison with the extension of the surface region a key quantity is the center of gravity of the screening charge. This complex function of the frequency is important for a number of properties such as the reflectivity, the surface plasmon dispersion, image fields, van der Waals interactions between a molecule and a metal surface, etc. Considerations similar to the ones for a planar surface are also applied to the surface properties of a small metallic sphere.</abstract>

      <abstract>It has been assumed that the optical properties of small spheres can be understood by means of a Drude dielectric function that incorporates a boundary scattering rate 1 / tau s =vF / R, where vF is the Fermi velocity and R is the sphere radius. An effective scattering rate 1 / tau s=fvF / R is calculated and f is evaluated as a function of photon frequency. The largest contribution to f is due to the electron density profile of the sphere rather than the boundary scattering that is reduced an order of magnitude by electron screening.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this work we survey some recent results concerning non-local otical effects and particle-size dependence for the optical properties of individual metallic particles. {W}e start by giving a historical overview and a conceptual discussion on the subject of small particles, underlining their potential applications. {S}implified optical response functions for a metallic sphere are introduced and duly illustrated to bring out the physical content. {P}articular emphasis is given to optical absorption, resonance effects and far-infrared properties exhibited by simple and noble metal particles having less than 100 {\AA} radii. {A} comparison between the traditional ({M}ie) approach and the proposed non-local scheme is made and it leads to an increased understanding of the various mechanisms a small particle exhibits when screening an external electromagnetic field.</abstract>

      <abstract>For developing a magnetic bioassay system, an investigation to determine the presence of a specific biomolecular interaction between biotin and streptavidin was done using magnetic nanoparticles and a silicon substrate with a self-assembled monolayer. Streptavidin was immobilized on the magnetic particles, and biotin was attached to the monolayer-modified substrate. The reaction of streptavidin-modified magnetic particles on the biotin-modified substrate was clearly observed under an optical microscope. The magnetic signals from the particles were detected using a magnetic force microscope. The results of this study demonstrate that the combination of a monolayer-modified substrate with biomolecule-modified magnetic particles is useful for detecting biomolecular interactions in medical and diagnostic analyses. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</abstract>

      <abstract>Using synthetic oligonucleotides as probes we have cloned the streptavidin gene from a genomic library of Streptomyces avidinii. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that a 2 Kb DNA-fragment contained the entire coding region, a signal peptide region and the 3' and 5' flanking regions of the gene. The deduced amino acid sequence shows several interrupted blocks of homology with the amino acid sequence of chicken egg-white avidin. Analysis of the secondary structure suggests a high content of beta-structure in both proteins and considerable overall structural similarity between them.</abstract>

      <abstract>Gold colloids are well known to display strong plasmon absorption bands due to electron oscillations induced by the incident light. When the colloids are in proximity, the plasmon absorption bands are often perturbed. This has enabled us recently to successfully develop a glucose sensing platform based on the disassociation of dextrancoated gold colloids, cross-linked with Con A, by glucose. However, a much more useful and simpler property of gold colloids, which has been ill explored with regard to sensing, is their ability to efficiently scatter excitation fight. We have found that our nanogold sensing aggregates are indeed efficient light scatters around the nanogold plasmon absorption band. By measuring the ratio of scattered fight intensities at two different arbitrary wavelengths, 560 and 680 nm, glucose concentrations can be readily determined from a few millimolar up to similar to 60 mM, using a simple white light LED and detection system. Further, by measuring the ratio of the scattered intensities, this sensing approach is independent of the total sensing aggregate concentration and the excitation and detection instrumentation fluctuations or drifts. This simplistic and low-cost approach to glucose sensing, coupled with the sensing aggreagates' ability to scatter red light, suggests the potential use of these aggregates for use in physiological transdermal glucose monitoring, either for implantable skin sensors or glucose sensing tattoos (discussed later).</abstract>

      <abstract>Biotinylated gold nanoparticles were prepared by using a two-step surface modification procedure. First, a carboxyl-terminated alkanethiol was chemisorbed onto the surface of gold nanoparticles in the presence of a stabilizing agent. Subsequently, the carboxyl groups were reacted with (+)-biotinyl-3,6,9,-trioxaundecanediamine and 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol. This procedure resulted in stable, ligand-modified gold nanoparticles. Upon interaction with streptavidin, the biotinylated gold nanoparticles aggregated by means of specific biomolecular recognition. Their aggregation was studied by optical absorption spectroscopy. Controlled aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles resulted in a shift in the surface plasmon resonance peak and broadening of the absorption spectrum of the nanoparticles. The spectral changes were used to assess the extent of aggregation. Aggregation was found to be dependent on the concentrations of streptavidin, biotinylated gold nanoparticles, and the surface mole fraction of biotin groups on the nanoparticles. Maximum aggregation was observed when 24 nM streptavidin and 0.80 nM biotinylated gold nanoparticles were used. Reversal of nanoparticle aggregation was accomplished by the addition of soluble biotin to the streptavidin-nanoparticle aggregates. Kinetic analysis of the absorbance data showed that streptavidin-induced aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles could be interpreted in terms of a Reaction-Limited Colloidal Aggregation (RLCA) model. This indicates that optical absorption spectroscopy can provide a quantitative measurement of the aggregation process.</abstract>

      <abstract>A fluorescence-based detection scheme that uses ligand functionalized gold nanoparticles is proposed. The transduction scheme is based on the strong quenching of the fluorescence emission exerted by metallic surfaces on fluorophores positioned in their immediate vicinity (&lt;5 nm). Binding of fluorophore-labeled anti-biotin to biotinylated gold nanoparticles resulted in decreasedfluorescence emission intensity. Subsequent competitive dissociation of labeled anti-biotin with D-biotin resulted in increased fluorescence emission intensity. These interactions occurred by means of specific molecular recognition because when the binding sites of anti-biotin were saturated with D-biotin prior to interaction with the gold nanoparticles; changes in the fluorescence emission intensity were not observed.</abstract>

      <abstract>We report on fluorescence enhancement in near field optical spectroscopy by apertureless microscopy. Our apertureless microscope is designed around a confocal fluorescence microscope associated with an AFM head. First, we show that the confocal microscope alone allows single molecule imaging and single molecule fluorescence analysis. When associated with the AFM head, we demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that single molecule fluorescence is enhanced under the silicon tip. We tentatively attribute this effect to field enhancement under the tip.</abstract>

      <abstract>Excited-state interactions between chlorophyll a (Chla) and gold nanoparticles have been studied. The emission intensity of Chla is quenched by gold nanoparticles. The dominant process for this quenching has been attributed to the process of photoinduced electron transfer from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, although because of a small overlap between fluorescence of Chla and absorption of gold nanoparticles, the energy-transfer process cannot be ruled out. Photoinduced electron-transfer mechanism is supported by the electrochemical modulation of fluorescence of Chla. In absence of an applied bias, Chla cast on gold film, as a result of electron transfer, exhibits a very weak fluorescence. However, upon negatively charging the gold nanocore by external bias, an increase in fluorescence intensity is observed. The negatively charged gold nanoparticles create a barrier and suppress the electron-transfer process from excited Chla to gold nanoparticles, resulting in an increase in radiative process. Nanosecond laser flash experiments of Chla in the presence of gold nanoparticles and fullerene (C-60) have demonstrated that Au nanoparticles, besides accepting electrons, can also mediate or shuttle electrons to another acceptor. Taking advantage of these properties of gold nanoparticles, a photoelectrochemical cell based on Chla and gold nanoparticles is constructed. A superior performance of this cell compared to that without the gold film is due to the beneficial role of gold nanoparticles in accepting and shuttling the photogenerated electrons in Chla to the collecting electrode, leading to an enhancement in charge separation efficiency.</abstract>

      <abstract>Theoretical expressions for the internal and external electromagnetic fields for an arbitrary electromagnetic beam incident upon a homogeneous spherical particle are derived, and numerical calculations based upon this theoretical development are presented. In particular, spatial distributions of the internal and near-surface electric field magnitude (source function) for a focused fundamental (TEM00 mode) Gaussian beam of 1.06 µm wavelength and 4 µm beam waist diameter incident upon a 5-µm-diam water droplet in air are presented as a function of the location of the beam focal point relative to the sphere center. The calculations indicate that the internal and near-surface electric field magnitude distribution can be strongly dependent upon relative focal point positioning and may differ significantly from the corresponding electric field magnitude distribution expected from plane-wave irradiation.</abstract>

      <abstract>Using particle tracking routines the location of single point light sources can be determined with an accuracy of a few nanometers. By using quantum dots (QDs) emitting at different wavelengths, the measurement of the distance between these point light sources, which are closer than the optical resolution of 200 nm, was achieved. The nanocrystals have major advantages over conventional chromophores in higher quantum yield, more photostability, and the possibility of different emission wavelengths by an excitation with a single wavelength. The colocalization of two single QDs at the least distance of 40 nm can be measured with a standard deviation of 5 nm and a time resolution of 117 ms using one excitation wavelength.</abstract>

      <abstract>A new method for the preparation of a more efficient, stable iminobiotin-containing resin for the isolation of streptavidin was developed. CL-Sepharose was activated with p-nitrophenyl chloroformate, and the resultant carbonate derivative was reacted with diaminohexane. Subsequent reaction of the amino-containing resin with iminobiotin-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (in an organic solvent) yielded the stable affinity resin. The capacity of this resin for either avidin of streptavidin was 12 mg per ml resin, and streptavidin could be purified in one step directly from the culture broth of Streptomyces avidinii. The biotin-binding protein isolated in this manner exhibited a major band at about 75 kDa and a minor band at about 150 kDa. Under denaturing conditions, a spectrum of subunit molecular weights ranging between 15 and 19 kDa was detected, the distributiob of which depended upon the specific preparation.</abstract>

      <abstract>Streptavidin, an extracellular biotin-binding protein from Streptomyces avidinii, exhibits a multiplicity in its electrophoretic mobility pattern which depends both upon the conditions for growth of the bacterium and upon the protocol used in the purification of the protein. The observed structural heterogeneity appears to reflect the action of two types of postsecretory molecular events: proteolytic digestion of the intact Mr-18,000 subunit to a minimal molecular size (approx. Mr 14,000), and aggregation of the native tetramer into higher-order oligomeric forms. The extent of subunit degradation and/or tetrameric aggregation affects the capacity of a given streptavidin preparation to interact with biotin-conjugated proteins in different assay systems.</abstract>

      <abstract>We observe an enhancement of fluorescence from a single fluorescent sphere, which is sandwiched between two individual gold nanoparticles, forming a hot spot of strong field enhancement. The fluorescence enhancing hot spot is custom-designed by the deliberate assembly of gold nanoparticles with an atomic force microscope cantilever. The fluorescence intensity is monitored while the separation between the two gold nanoparticles is reduced by gradually pushing the gold nanoparticles closer to the fluorescent sphere. The fluorescence enhancement is maximal when the distance between the two gold nanoparticles is smallest, when the excitation polarization is parallel to the axis of the sandwich, and when the fluorescent sphere is positioned exactly on the axis connecting the two gold nanoparticles.</abstract>

Among the methods used for characterizing receptor clusters, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a donor and acceptor fluorophore plays a unique role based on its capability of detecting molecular level (2-10 nm) proximities of receptors in physiological conditions. Recent development of biotechnology has made possible the usage of colloidal gold particles in a large size range for specific labelling of cells for the purposes of electron microscopy. However, by combining metal and fluorophore labelling or cells, the versatility of metal-fluorophore interactions opens the way for new applications by detecting the presence of the metal particles by the methods of fluorescence spectroscopy. An outstanding feature of the metal nanoparticle-fluorophore interaction is that the metal particle can enhance spontaneous emission of the fluorophore in a distance-dependent fashion, in an interaction range esentially determined by the size of the nanoparticle. In our work enhanced fluorescence of rhodamine and cyanine dyes was observed in the vicinity of immunogold nanoparticles on the surface of JY cells in a flow cytometer. The dyes and the immunogold were targetted to the cell surface receptors MHCI, MHCII, transferrin receptor and CD45 by monoclonal antibodies. The fluorescence enhancement was sensitive to the wavelength of the exciting light, the size and amount of surface bound gold beads, as well as the fluorophore-nanoparticle distance. The intensity of 90&amp;DEG; scattering of the incident light beam was enhanced by the immunogold in a concentration and size-dependent fashion. The 90&amp;DEG; light scattering varied with the wavelength of the incident light in a manner characteristic to gold nanoparticles of the applied sizes. A reduction in photobleaching time constant of the cyanine dye was observed in the vicinity of gold particles in a digital imaging microscope. Modulations of 90&amp;DEG; light scattering intensity and photobleaching time constant indicate the role of the local field in the fluorescence enhancement. A mathematical simulation based on the electrodynamic theory of fluorescence enhancement showed a consistency between the measured enhancement values, the inter-epitope distances and the quantum yields. The feasibility of realizing proximity sensors operating at distance ranges larger than that of the conventional Forster transfer is demonstrated on the surface of living cells.

      <abstract>We introduce a new, highly sensitive, and simple heterodyne optical method for imaging individual nonfluorescent nanoclusters and nanocrystals. A 2 order of magnitude improvement of the signal is achieved compared to previous methods. This allows for the unprecedented detection of individual small absorptive objects such as metallic clusters (of 67 atoms) or nonluminescent semiconductor nanocrystals. The measured signals are in agreement with a calculation based on the scattering field theory from a photothermal-induced modulated index of refraction profile around the nanoparticle.</abstract>

      <abstract>The photothermal heterodyne imaging method is used to study for the first time the absorption spectra of individual gold nanoparticles with diameters down to 5 nm. Intrinsic size effects that result in a broadening of the surface plasmon resonance are unambiguously observed. Dispersions in the peak energies and homogeneous widths of the single-particle resonances are revealed. The experimental results are analyzed within the frame of Mie theory.</abstract>

      <abstract>The fluorescence from a single molecule can be strongly enhanced near a metal nanoparticle acting as an optical antenna. We demonstrate the spectral tunability of this antenna effect and show that maximum enhancement is achieved when the emission frequency is red-shifted from the surface plasmon resonance of the particle. Our experimental results, using individual gold and silver particles excited at different laser-frequencies, are in good agreement with an analytical theory which predicts a different spectral dependence of the radiative and non-radiative decay rates.</abstract>

      <abstract>A novel photoluminescence is reported for small metal nanocrystals in the near-infrared region (1.1-1.6 m). Near-infrared photoluminescence spectra were measured at room temperature for 1.1 and 1.7 nm Au nanocrystals using a 1.06 m excitation source. This photoluminescence is attributed to sp to sp-like transitions, analogous to intraband transitions in bulk gold; however, the exact mechanism is unknown. A conservative estimate for the quantum yield for the 1.7 nm gold nanocrystals is (4.4 ± 1.5) × 10-5 at room temperature, more than 5 orders of magnitude greater than that of bulk gold.</abstract>

      <abstract>The spontaneous emission of an excited atom surrounded by different materials is studied in the framework of a semiclassical approach, where the transition dipole moment acts as the source of the emission field. The emission in the presence of semiinfinite media, metallic nanorings, spheres, gratings, and other complex geometries is investigated. Strong emission enhancement effects are obtained in some of these geometries associated to the excitation of plasmons (e.g., in nanorings or spheres). Furthermore, the emission is shown to take place only along narrow angular distributions when the atom is located inside a low-index dielectric and near its planar surface, or when metallic nanogratings are employed at certain resonant wave lengths. In particular, axially symmetric gratings made of real silver metal are considered, and both emission rate enhancement and focused far-field emission are achieved simultaneously when the grating is decorated with further nanostructures.</abstract>

      <abstract>Summary Optical far-field imaging of single molecules in a frozen solution at 1.2 K with a lateral resolution of 3.4 nm is reported. The mechanical stability of the fluorescence microscope, especially of the low-temperature insert, allows for the localization of fluorescing molecules with a reproducibility of better than 5 nm within observation times up to 10 min. For observation times of 9 h the reproducibility of the lateral position is limited to about 20 nm due to mechanical drift. Lateral position and orientation of 314 single molecules, present within the confocal detection volume of  10 um3, are obtained. The possibility to correct for mechanical drift by monitoring the position of a spatial reference in the sample is demonstrated.</abstract>

      <abstract>Molecular beacons are DNA probes that form a stem-and-loop structure and possess an internally quenched fluorophore. When they bind to complementary nucleic acids, they undergo a conformational transition that switches on their fluorescence. These probes recognize their targets with higher specificity than probes that cannot form a hairpin stem, and they easily discriminate targets that differ from one another by only a single nucleotide. Our results show that molecular beacons can exist in three different states: bound to a target, free in the form of a hairpin structure, and free in the form of a random coil. Thermodynamic analysis of the transitions between these states reveals that enhanced specificity is a general feature of conformationally constrained probes.</abstract>

      <abstract>Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) from Rhodamine 6G adsorbed on small, optically resolvable aggregates of silver nanoparticles is detectable at the single-molecule level. The signal fluctuates on a second time scale, presumably due to movement of the molecule in to and out of the SERS active "hot spots". The depolarization of the signal is found to be independent of the fluctuations, to vary from one spot to the next, and to be highly dependent on the direction of the incident electric field. The "SERS continuum" dominates the signal and is assumed to arise from electronic Raman processes in the metal that are triggered by chemisorption of the molecule in the hot spot. The source of the Raman signal is therefore highly localized around the hot spot. The local structure determines the depolarization properties and is often extremely anisotropic. Conversely, the Rayleigh scattering does not depend on the molecule or the hot spot and is delocalized over the whole aggregate, which is always found to be highly isotropic. The Rayleigh scattering therefore does not fluctuate and is always highly polarized.</abstract>

      <abstract>Single two-dimensional planar silver arrays and one-dimensional linear gold chains of nanoparticles were investigated by dark-field surface plasmon spectroscopy and studied as a function of interparticle distance, particle size, and number of particles. In agreement with recent theoretical predictions, a red shift of the surface plasmon resonance occurring in two-dimensional arrays was found for lattice spacings below 200 nm. This red shift is associated with a significant broadening of the resonance and is attributed to the onset of near-field interactions. We found that the relative contributions of the long-range and short-range interactions in two-dimensional arrays of particles are fundamentally different to those occurring in individual linear chains.an</abstract>

      <abstract>We extend the plasmon hybridization method to investigate the plasmon modes of metallic nanoshell dimers. The formalism is also generalized to include the effects of dielectric backgrounds. It is shown that the presence of dielectrics shifts the plasmon resonances of the individual nanoparticles to lower energies and screens their interaction in the dimer configuration. The net result is a redshift of dimer energies compared to the system without dielectrics and a weaker dependence of the dimer plasmon energies on dimer separation. We calculate the plasmon energies and optical absorption of nanoshell dimers as a function of dimer separation. The results are in excellent agreement with the results of finite difference time domain simulations.</abstract>

      <abstract>Progress in near-field optical spectroscopy research on metal narroparticles demands a better understanding of the role of particle-particle and tip-sample interactions. In this perspective, we investigate theoretically, at a very moderate level of sophistication, the optical behavior of simple silver nanoparticle aggregates, in terms of a formalism involving a multipolar expansion of the fields involved, along with a simplified model for the optical behavior of nanostructures previously developed. In particular, the tip-sample interaction is taken into account roughly, treating the tip as an additional, single particle, characterized by proper dielectric behavior.</abstract>

      <abstract>Using scanning probe techniques, we show the controlled manipulation of the radiation from single dipoles. In one experiment we study the modification of the fluorescence lifetime of a single molecular dipole in front of a movable silver mirror. A second experiment demonstrates the changing plasmon spectrum of a gold nanoparticle in front of a dielectric mirror. Comparison of our data with theoretical models allows determination of the quantum efficiency of each radiating dipole.</abstract>

      <abstract>The spectroscopic characteristics (absorption, emission, and fluorescence lifetime) of 13 commercially available red-absorbing fluorescent dyes were studied under a variety of conditions. The dyes included in this study are Alexa647, ATTO655, ATTO680, Bodipy630/650, Cy5, Cy5.5, DiD, DY-630, DY-635, DY-640, DY-650, DY-655, and EVOblue30. The thorough characterization of this class of dyes will facilitate selection of the appropriate red-absorbing fluorescent labels for applications in fluorescence assays. The influences of polarity, viscosity, and the addition of detergent (Tween20) on the spectroscopic properties were investigated, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) was utilized to assess the photophysical properties of the dyes under high excitation conditions. The dyes can be classified into groups based on the results presented. For example, while the fluorescence quantum yield of ATTO655, ATTO680, and EVOblue30 is primarily controlled by the polarity of the surrounding medium, more hydrophobic and structurally flexible dyes of the DY-family are strongly influenced by the viscosity of the medium and the addition of detergents. Covalent binding of the dyes to biotin and subsequent addition of streptavidin results in reversible fluorescence quenching or changes in the relaxation time of other photophysical processes of some dyes, most likely due to interactions with tryptophan residues in the streptavin binding site.</abstract>

      <abstract>Analytical ultracentrifugation (AU) provides a general way to probe the polydispersity of nanoparticles and the formation of bioconjugates in solution. Unconjugated gold nanocrystals show sedimentation coefficient distributions that are in agreement with size distributions as measured by TEM. AU is sensitive to the size/shape changes elicited by conjugation, in this case to lactose repressor (LacI). AU data reveal saturating protein concentrations for conjugates that correspond to the measured stoichiometry of the complex under these conditions.</abstract>

      <abstract>Colloidal gold nanoparticles were conjugated with oligonucleotides to create biorecognition nanomodules. The efficiency of conjugation was determined by fluorescence using a FITC-labelled thiolated model probe and by enzyme-linked nanoparticle assay (ELINA) using a digoxigeninlabelled thiolated model probe. The thermal stability of the conjugation was determined by displacement and fluorescence measurement of the FITC probe. Functionality for hybridisation was determined by enzyme-linked oligonucleotide assay (ELONA). It was found that the equilibrium oligonucleotide surface coverage reached 37% of the total nanoparticle area. These results could be verified by ELINA. Under hybridisation conditions that allowed the detection of 4-point mutations on a target 19-rner sequence (1 h at 65 C), it was found that the bio functionalised nanomodules lost between 10 and 30% of the conjugated biorecognition molecules.</abstract>

      <abstract>Multiplexed detection of oligonucleotide targets has been performed with gold nanoparticle probes labeled with oligonucleotides and Raman-active dyes. The gold nanoparticles facilitate the formation of a silver coating that acts as a surface-enhanced Raman scattering promoter for the dye-labeled particles that have been captured by target molecules and an underlying chip in microarray format. The strategy provides the high-sensitivity and high-selectivity attributes of gray-scale scanometric detection but adds multiplexing and ratioing capabilities because a very large number of probes can be designed based on the concept of using a Raman tag as a narrow-band spectroscopic fingerprint. Six dissimilar DNA targets with six Raman-labeled nanoparticle probes were distinguished, as well as two RNA targets with single nucleotide polymorphisms. The current unoptimized detection limit of this method is 20 femtomolar.</abstract>

      <abstract>We study the spontaneous emission of a single emitter close to a metallic nanoparticle, with the aim to clarify the distance dependence of the radiative and non-radiative decay rates. We derive analytical formulas based on a dipole-dipole model, and show that the non-radiative decay rate follows a R-6 dependence at short distance, where R is the distance between the emitter and the center of the nanoparticle, as in Forster's energy transfer. The distance dependence of the radiative decay rate is more subtle. It is chiefly dominated by a R-3 dependence, a R-6 dependence being visible at plasmon resonance. The latter is a consequence of radiative damping in the effective dipole polarizability of the nanoparticle. The different distance behavior of the radiative and non-radiative decay rates implies that the apparent quantum yield always vanishes at short distance. Moreover, non-radiative decay is strongly enhanced when the emitter radiates at the plasmon-resonance frequency of the nanoparticle.</abstract>

      <abstract>Streptavidin, a crystalline protein isolated from fermentation filtrates of streptomycetes has been reported to have biotin-binding ability similar to avidin. A comparison has been made between streptavidin and avidin from egg white using microbiological, physical, and chemical methods. Streptavidin binds four molecules of biotin. Chemical analysis shows the absence of hexoses and amino sugars associated with avidin and reveals differences in amino acid content. Electrophoretic studies give different mobilities for streptavidin and avidin. Thus, streptavidin is a new type of biotin-binding protein.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present a theoretical analysis of optical force on a molecule near a metal sphere by taking into account the change of decay rate as well as the shift of resonance frequency in the response of the metal surface. As a result, the optical force is determined not only by the gradient of field but also the polarizability depending on the position and orientation of the molecule. In addition, we find the resulting reactive force cannot be expressed as a gradient of a scalar potential, in contrast to the usual situations.</abstract>

      <abstract>We study the local-field enhancement in a nanocavity created by optical nanomanipulation. Recently we showed that a metallic probe can modify the optical force experienced by a metallic particle and generate a material selective trapping potential. We show that the same configuration used for optical forces can be used to control both in magnitude and tune the local-field enhancement around the particle at resonance. The spatial resolution and material selectivity of this technique, allied to its capability to manipulate particles at the nanometric level, may offer a new and versatile way to achieve surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy at the single-molecule level.</abstract>

      <abstract>For the first time, an aqueous solution of 32-nm gold nanoparticles (GNPs), to which Nile red (NR) has been noncovalently adsorbed, has been used for sensing thiols. The as-prepared NRGNPs fluoresce weakly as a result of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between NR and the GNPs. The fluorescence of a solution containing NRGNPs at pH 4.0 increases upon the addition of thiols, but not when amines, acids, alcohols, bovine serum albumin, or hemoglobin are added. This phenomenon allows for the selective determination of thiols such as cysteamine and homocysteine, which have limits of detection of 10.2 and 10.9 nM, respectively, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. Interestingly, we have found that the excitation (ex = 480 nm), emission (em = 610 nm), and mass spectra (m/z 282) of the substance that desorbs from the GNPs in the presence of thiols are different from those of NR (ex = 580 nm; em = 652 nm; m/z 318), which indicates that a new product forms. When simultaneously conducting fluorescence and colorimetric assays, the selectivity of this approach further improves because at pH 4.0, the color of the NRGNPs does not change in the presence of negatively charged thiols, (e.g., N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine), but changes from maroon to purple and lavender in the presence of neutral thiols (e.g., 3-mercapto-1,2-propanediol) and positively charged thiols (e.g., cysteamine), respectively, as a result of aggregation. This feature allows the types of thiols to be determined at concentrations &gt;1.0 and 0.1 µM by the naked eye and by UV-vis absorption, respectively. Depending on the rate at which the NRGNP color changes, reduced glutathione (slow) is readily distinguishable from oxidized glutathione (no aggregation and no displacement) and from cysteine and homocysteine (fast).</abstract>

      <abstract>We investigate the fluorescence from dyes coupled to individual DNA-functionalized metal nanoparticles. We use single-particle darkfield scattering and fluorescence microscopy to correlate the fluorescence intensity of the dyes with the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectra of the individual metal nanoparticles to which they are attached. For each of three different dyes, we observe a strong correlation between the fluorescence intensity of the dye and the degree of spectral overlap with the plasmon resonance of the nanoparticle. On average, we observe the brightest fluorescence from dyes attached to metal nanoparticles that have a LSPR scattering peak  40-120 meV higher in energy than the emission peak of the fluorophore. These results should prove useful for understanding and optimizing metal-enhanced fluorescence.</abstract>

      <abstract>The transition rates of atoms inside spherical dielectric particles are computed and studied as functions of the transition frequency and of the physical properties of the host particle. The rates are found to range from about 0.2 to more than 1500 times the free-space value, depending on the location of the atom and other relevant physical parameters. The radiation from distributions of atoms inside liquid drops is also studied. Analytic and numerical results are given for the case of a uniform distribution of excited atoms. Large enhancements of the power output (some 100 times the value for the same distribution in bulk material) are found to occur under resonant conditions.</abstract>

      <abstract>We study the transition rates of atoms inside and outside dielectric spheres. The rates are calculated classically, and the results are shown to agree with those obtained using other approaches. For atoms outside, our analytic results are equivalent to those of Ruppin in the case of zero conductivity. Numerical results are presented, which show that resonances have important effects on the transition rates, and that enhancement factors of hundreds are possible under suitable conditions.

      <abstract>A model for Raman and fluorescent scattering by molecules embedded in small particles is described. This takes into account the effect of the particle's geometrical and optical properties upon the unshifted field which excites the molecular transitions within the particle, and upon the shifted field. Formulas are given which relate the angular distribution of the scattered radiation to the nature of the molecular scatterers and to the size and refractive index of the particle. These results are relevant for current problems in cell biology and atmospheric physics.</abstract>

      <abstract>We report the functional characterization of site-directed biotin binding-site mutants of recombinant core streptavidin. The mutagenesis studies were aimed at characterizing the contributions of Trp residues known to contact biotin that have been postulated to control the exceptional binding affinity observed in this system. The functional properties of single site-directed mutants replacing Trp residues with Phe or Ala at positions 79, 108, and 120 were investigated by quantitating the EC50 binding parameters of these mutants to biotin and 2-iminobiotin in an ELISA format. The biotin EC50 for all mutants was the same as wild-type streptavidin, demonstrating that their DeltaKa values relative to wild type were &lt;106. The conservative W79F and W108F mutants displayed only a 2- to 3-fold increase in EC50 for 2-iminobiotin, corresponding to an estimated DeltaKa &lt;10, while the W120F mutant displayed a much greater alteration in 2-iminobiotin EC50, corresponding to an estimated DeltaKa of 102. These DeltaKa values are likely to reflect similar changes for biotin. The 2-iminobiotin EC50 values for the Ala mutants fell outside the accessible concentration range of the ELISA assay, demonstrating that these mutations lowered the Ka by a factor of 104 to 106. Direct estimation of biotin Ka values for W79A, W120A, and W120F in an ultrafiltration binding assay yielded Ka values of 4.3 x 107 M-1, 8.6 x 106 M-1, and &gt;5 x 109 M-1, respectively, in excellent agreement with the ELISA estimates of DeltaKa with 2-iminobiotin as a reporter ligand. The results of these preliminary functional studies suggest that these aromatic side chains contribute significantly to the streptavidin-biotin binding free energy.</abstract>

      <abstract>While the conceptual framework for nanoplasmonic waveguides composed of a chain of noncontacting metal nanoparticles usually neglects the effects of the ends, the long-range nature of the interparticle coupling underlying the electromagnetic transport means that finite chain length can play an important role. Here, the complex energies of the plasmon-polariton modes in finite-length nanoparticle chains are calculated to ascertain the effects of chain length on the mode dispersion and the radiative contribution to the attenuation. The results indicate that, for typical parameters, the infinite-chain limit is reached with  10 nanoparticles. Thus, even for chain lengths well exceeding the attenuation length, long-range coupling of distant nanoparticles is shown to impact the dispersion and radiative loss.</abstract>

      <abstract>The concept of self-assembled dendrimers is explored for the creation of discrete nanoparticle assemblies. Hybridization of branched DNA trimers and nanoparticle-DNA conjugates results in the synthesis of nanoparticle trimer and tetramer complexes. Multiple tetramer architectures are investigated, utilizing Au-DNA conjugates with varying secondary structural motifs. Hybridization products are analyzed by gel electrophoresis, and discrete bands are observed corresponding to structures with increasing numbers of hybridization events. Samples extracted from each band are analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, and statistics compiled from micrographs are used to compare assembly characteristics for each architecture. Asymmetric structures are also produced in which both 5- and 10-nm Au particles are assembled on branched scaffolds.</abstract>

      <abstract>We performed a visualization of membrane proteins labeled with 10-nm gold nanoparticles in cells, using an all-optical method based on photothermal interference contrast. The high sensitivity of the method and the stability of the signals allows 3D imaging of individual nanoparticles without the drawbacks of photobleaching and blinking inherent to fluorescent markers. A simple analytical model is derived to account for the measurements of the signal amplitude and the spatial resolution. The photothermal interference contrast method provides an efficient, reproducible, and promising way to visualize low amounts of proteins in cells by optical means.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present a model for the evaluation of the metal-induced deexcitation rate for molecules close to a metal surface. In this model, the molecule is treated quantum mechanically at the density-functional theory level and its excitations with a time-dependent density-functional theory procedure. The metal is described through its dielectric response properties. The nonlocal features of such a response are taken into account by using a modified Lindhard-Mermin dielectric constant. The presence of small random roughness on the metal surface is described with the model of Rahman and Maradudin [Phys. Rev. B 21, 504 (1980)]. Systems in which the molecule close to the metal is immersed in an homogeneous matrix or deposited on a spacer are considered. The matrix and the spacer are treated with the polarizable continuum model. The molecule-metal and the molecule-matrix (or molecule-spacer) electrostatic interactions are described by using the integral equation formalism, numerically treated with a boundary element method. As a test case, the method has been applied to the study of phosphorescence from biacetyl close to a silver surface and immersed in or deposited on solid ammonia. Our results show that nonlocal metal response and surface roughness have an important role in explaining measured lifetimes.</abstract>

      <abstract>A model for the calculation of excitation energies of molecules close to a metal surface is presented. The molecule is treated at the density functional theory (DFT) or Hartree-Fock (HF) level and the excitation energies are calculated through a time dependent DFT (TDDFT) or time dependent HF (TDHF) procedure. The metal is treated as a continuous body characterized by its frequency dependent dielectric constant, taken from experiments, in the case modified to take into account nonlocal effects in the response to the metal. Such effects are accounted for by using the specular reflection model and a hydrodynamic correction to the dielectric constant. The presence of a solvent is described with the Polarizable Continuum Model. The (quasi-)electrostatic interactions between the molecule and the metal-solvent environment are treated by exploiting the integral equation formalism, numerically solved through a boundary element method. Applications of the method are given to show its numerical accuracy and the dependence of the results on the various parameters of the model (e.g., nature of the molecule, solvent, chemical nature of the metal, metal-molecule distance).</abstract>

      <abstract>Gold nanoparticles with a single carboxylic acid group on the surface were prepared from a solid phase place exchange reaction and then coupled to polylysine using an in situ activation agent, diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIPCDI). The covalent amide bond linkage between the nanoparticles and polylysine and the ring closure of the polylysine chain have led to the formation of a nanoparticle/polymer hybrid material with "nanonecklace" structures.</abstract>

      <abstract>Time-resolved absorption spectroscopy on the femtosecond time scale has been used to monitor the earliest events associated with excited-state relaxation in tris-(2,2'-bipyridine)ruthenium(II). The data reveal dynamics associated with the temporal evolution of the Franck-Condon state to the lowest energy excited state of this molecule. The process is essentially complete in sim 300 femtoseconds after the initial excitation. This result is discussed with regard to reformulating long-held notions about excited-state relaxation, as well as its implication for the importance of non-equilibrium excited-state processes in understanding and designing molecular-based electron transfer, artificial photosynthetic, and photovoltaic assemblies in which compounds of this class are currently playing a key role.</abstract>

      <abstract>We examine a quantum mechanical model for the enhancement of fluorescence yield and photochemical rates by the presence of a small particle capable to sustain electromagnetic resonances. the sphere lowers the absorption and emission efficiency by taking energy from the molecule and storing it in non-radiative modes, enhances the absorption by increasing the local field, and enhances the fluorescence by emitting efficiently the energy transferred from the emitting state ti a radiative electromegnetic resonance of the particle. The present paper studies how the interplay of these effectd modifies fluorescence intensity and the rate of photochemical reactions.</abstract>

      <abstract>We examine the classical energy-balance equation for a fluorescing system consisting of a molecule near a small, spherical metal particle capable of sustaining electromagnetic resonances and irradiated with laser light. From the energy-flow distribution in the entire system, we obtain the enhancement factor for the fluorescence emission of the adsorbed molecule. Numerical results demonstrate that the electromagnetic interactions of the molecule and the surface can be understood in terms of energy flow through the entire system and applied to investigate spectroscopic properties of adsorbates in similar systems. Absorption and emission rates of the adsorbed molecule are determined considering the energy-flow distribution and its dependence on the substrate as well as molecular parameters. Such understanding is useful in predicting spectroscopic responses of adsorbates.</abstract>

      <abstract>We develop a simple semiclassical method for calculating the polarizability of a very small spherical particle by taking into account the nonlocal nature of the dielectric response. Our theory is very general in the sense that it can be applied to any material which can be characterized by a bulk dielectric function of the form epsilon B(k-&gt;, omega ): We introduce a new additional boundary condition (ABC) which is similar but not exactly equivalent to the Fuchs-Kliewer ABC. The theory is applied to calculate the polarizabilities of dielectric and metallic spheres.</abstract>

      <abstract>We developed a technique for the local electrical detection of a plasmon resonance in a single metal nanoparticle. A gold nanoparticle is coupled to a GaAs photodetector placed in the particle's near field. Light scattered by the particle is coupled into the semiconductor cavity of the photodetector, providing efficient transduction. Strong multipolar resonances were recorded in the 650-920 nm wavelength range. This local detection technique allows the construction of sensitive nanoscale bioprobes and arrays thereof.</abstract>

      <abstract>Using a fluorescence-based method, we have determined the number of thiol-derivatized single-stranded oligonucleotides bound to gold nanoparticles and their extent of hybridization with complementary oligonucleotides in solution. Oligonucleotide surface coverages of hexanethiol 12-mer oligonucleotides on gold nanoparticles (34 ± 1 pmol/cm2) were significantly higher than on planar gold thin films (18 ± 3 pmol/cm2), while the percentage of hybridizable strands on the gold nanoparticles (1.3 ± 0.3 pmol/cm2, 4 pmol/cm2, 33 the course of oligonucleotide deposition significantly increases surface coverage and consequently particle stability. In addition, oligonucleotide spacer sequences improve the hybridization efficiency of oligonucleotide-modified nanoparticles from  4 to 44 coverage of recognition strands can be tailored using coadsorbed diluent oligonucleotides. This provides a means of indirectly controlling the average number of hybridized strands per nanoparticle. The work presented here has important implications with regard to understanding interactions between modified oligonucleotides and metal nanoparticles, as well as optimizing the sensitivity of gold nanoparticle-based oligonucleotide detection methods.</abstract>

      <abstract>The term ``sensitized luminescence'' in crystalline phosphors refers to the phenomenon whereby an impurity (activator, or emitter) is enabled to luminesce upon the absorption of light in a different type of center (sensitizer, or absorber) and upon the subsequent radiationless transfer of energy from the sensitizer to the activator. The resonance theory of Förster, which involves only allowed transitions, is extended to include transfer by means of forbidden transitions which, it is concluded, are responsible for the transfer in all inorganic systems yet investigated. The transfer mechanisms of importance are, in order of decreasing strength, the overlapping of the electric dipole fields of the sensitizer and the activator, the overlapping of the dipole field of the sensitizer with the quadrupole field of the activator, and exchange effects. These mechanisms will give rise to ``sensitization'' of about 10^3-10^4, 10^2, and 30 lattice sites surrounding each sensitizer in typical systems. The dependence of transfer efficiency upon sensitizer and activator concentrations and on temperature are discussed. Application is made of the theory to experimental results on inorganic phosphors, and further experiments are suggested.</abstract>

      <abstract>The dynamics of conformational isomerization are explored in a methyl-capped dipeptide, N-acetyl-tryptophan methyl amide (NATMA), using infrared-ultraviolet (IR-UV) hole-filling and IR-induced population transfer spectroscopies. IR radiation selectively excites individual NH stretch vibrational fundamentals of single conformations of the molecule in the early portions of a gas-phase expansion, and then this excited population is collisionally recooled into its conformational minima for subsequent conformation-specific detection. Efficient isomerization is induced by the IR excitation that redistributes population between the same conformations that have population in the absence of IR excitation. The quantum yields for transfer of the population into the various conformational minima depend uniquely on which conformation is excited and on which NH stretch vibration is excited within a given conformation.</abstract>

      <abstract>We studied the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency of different donor-acceptor labeled model DNA systems in aqueous solution from ensemble measurements and at the single molecule level. The donor dyes: tetramethylrhodamine (TMR); rhodamine 6G (R6G); and a carbocyanine dye (Cy3) were covalently attached to the 5?-end of a 40-mer model oligonucleotide. The acceptor dyes, a carbocyanine dye (Cy5), and a rhodamine derivative (JA133) were attached at modified thymidine bases in the complementary DNA strand with donor-acceptor distances of 5, 15, 25 and 35 DNA-bases, respectively. Anisotropy measurements demonstrate that none of the dyes can be observed as a free rotor; especially in the 5-bp constructs the dyes exhibit relatively high anisotropy values. Nevertheless, the dyes change their conformation with respect to the oligonucleotide on a slower time scale in the millisecond range. This results in a dynamic inhomogeneous distribution of donor/acceptor (D/A) distances and orientations. FRET efficiencies have been calculated from donor and acceptor fluorescence intensity as well as from time-resolved fluorescence measurements of the donor fluorescence decay. Dependent on the D/A pair and distance, additional strong fluorescence quenching of the donor is observed, which simulates lower FRET efficiencies at short distances and higher efficiencies at longer distances. On the other hand, spFRET measurements revealed subpopulations that exhibit the expected FRET efficiency, even at short D/A distances. In addition, the measured acceptor fluorescence intensities and lifetimes also partly show fluorescence quenching effects independent of the excitation wavelength, i.e. either directly excited or via FRET. These effects strongly depend on the D/A distance and the dyes used, respectively. The obtained data demonstrate that besides dimerization at short D/A distances, an electron transfer process between the acceptor Cy5 and rhodamine donors has to be taken into account. To explain deviations from FRET theory even at larger D/A distances, we suggest that the -stack of the DNA double helix mediates electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor, even over distances as long as 35 base pairs. Our data show that FRET experiments at the single molecule level are rather suited to resolve fluorescent subpopulations in heterogeneous mixture, information about strongly quenched subpopulations gets lost.</abstract>

      <abstract>Recent research in several groups has identified a new class of metal colloidal nanoparticles that is able to enhance the efficiencies of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) by as much as 1014-1015 fold. This enormous enhancement allows single-molecule detection and spectroscopy at room temperature. Previous single-molecule and single-particle studies have yielded important insights into the mechanism of electromagnetic field enhancement, but little is known about the contributions of surface active sites and chemical enhancement. Here we report a direct examination of chemical enhancement by using an integrated flow injection and ultrasensitive optical imaging/spectroscopy system. A key feature is that colloidal silver nanoparticles are immobilized on a glass surface inside a microflow device and that single-particle SERS signals are observed in real time while the immobilized particles are treated by chemical reagents in the flow cell. In situ surface plasmon scattering studies of spatially isolated particles indicate that their electromagnetic properties do not change after chemical treatment. Thus, the observed SERS spectral changes should primarily come from chemical enhancement at surface active sites. Our experimental data reveal that three halide ions (Cl-, Br-, and I-) have a substantial activating effect, whereas other ions such as citrate, sulfate, and fluoride have little or no effect on single-particle SERS. A "quenching" effect is observed for thiosulfate ions, which completely destroys the SERS activity. The chemical enhancement factors are estimated to be about 102-103 for rhodamine 6G molecules adsorbed on single Ag nanoparticles</abstract>

      <abstract>Antibody-antigen binding events at a monolayer protein concentration have been demonstrated on nanostructured adaptive silver films (ASFs) using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and luminescence-based assays. It is shown that proteins stabilize and restructure the ASF to increase the SERS signal while preserving antigen-binding activity. Evidence for antibody-antigen binding on the ASF substrates is the distinct SERS spectral changes of the surface-bound antibody or antigen without special tags. The activity of the surface-bound proteins and their practical application are validated by independent immunochemical assays. Results are presented to demonstrate that these surfaces can be extended to protein arrays with detection applications distinct from current SERS, fluorescence, or luminescence methods.</abstract>

      <abstract>The discrete dipole approximation (DDA), a flexible method for computing scattering of radiation by particles of arbitrary shape, is extended to incorporate the effects of radiative reaction and to allow for possible anisotropy of the dielectric tensor of the material. Formulas are given for the evaluation of extinction, absorption, scattering, and polarization cross sections. A simple numerical algorithm based on the method of conjugate gradients is found to provide an efficient and robust method for obtaining accurate solutions to the scattering problem. The method works well for absorptive, as well as dielectric, grain materials. Two validity criteria for the DDA are presented. The DDA is then used to compute extinction cross sections for spherical graphite grains and to calculate extinction cross sections for nonspherical graphite grains with three different geometries. It is concluded that the interstellar 2175 A extinction feature could be produced by small graphite grains which should have aspect ratios not far from unity.</abstract>

      <abstract>The discrete-dipole approximation (DDA) for scattering calculations, including the relationship between the DDA and other methods, is reviewed. Computational considerations, i.e., the use of complex-conjugate gradient algorithms and fast-Fourier-transform methods, are discussed. We test the accuracy of the DDA by using the DDA to compute scattering and absorption by isolated, homogeneous spheres as well as by targets consisting of two contiguous spheres. It is shown that, for dielectric materials (Iml c 2), the DDA permits calculations of scattering and absorption that are accurate to within a few percent.</abstract>

      <abstract>We derive the dispersion relation for electromagnetic waves propagating on a lattice of polarizable points. From this dispersion relation we obtain a prescription for choosing dipole polarizabilities so that an infinite lattice with finite lattice spacing will mimic a continuum with dielectric constant. The discrete dipole approximation is used to calculate scattering and absorption by a finite target by replacing the target with an array of point dipoles. We compare different prescriptions for determining the dipole polarizabilities. We show that the most accurate results are obtained when the lattice dispersion relation is used to set the polarizabilities.</abstract>

      <abstract>There is a keen interest in developing techniques for rapid genetic analysis that do not require labeling of an analyte. Here we demonstrate that fluorophore-tagged DNA hairpins attached to gold films can function as immobilized "molecular beacons". Two DNA hairpins incorporating portions of the Staphlococcus aureus FemA and mecR methicillin-resistance genes were attached to a gold substrate. Upon exposure to the complement, a  26-fold increase in fluorescence intensity was measured corresponding to a 96 ± 5 quenching efficiency. Studies with nonspecific DNA indicate that DNA hairpins immobilized on a gold surface retain their ability to bind complementary DNA sequences selectively.</abstract>

The fluorescence of this hybrid molecule increases by a factor of as much as several thousand as it binds to a complementary ssDNA. We show that this composite molecule is a different type of molecular beacon with a sensitivity enhanced up to 100-fold. In competitive hybridization assays, the ability to detect single mismatch is eightfold greater with this probe than with other molecular beacons.</abstract>

      <abstract>The radiative and nonradiative decay rates of lissamine dye molecules, chemically attached to differently sized gold nanoparticles, are investigated by means of time-resolved fluorescence experiments. A pronounced fluorescence quenching is observed already for the smallest nanoparticles of 1 nm radius. The quenching is caused not only by an increased nonradiative rate but, equally important, by a drastic decrease in the dye's radiative rate. Assuming resonant energy transfer to be responsible for the nonradiative decay channel, we compare our experimental findings with theoretical results derived from the Gersten-Nitzan model.</abstract>

      <abstract>Light emission at the particle plasmon frequency is observed in optically excited spherical gold nanoparticles. We find a photoluminescence efficiency of 10?6, which is essentially independent of particle size and four orders of magnitude higher than the efficiencies determined from metal films. Our experimental findings are explained with a process in which excited d-band holes recombine nonradiatively with sp electrons, emitting particle plasmons. These plasmons subsequently radiate, giving rise to the photoluminescence observed in the experiment. We determine the quantum efficiencies involved in this process.</abstract>

      <abstract>The fluorescence quantum yield of Cy5 molecules attached to gold nanoparticles via ssDNA spacers is measured for Cy5-nanoparticle distances between 2 and 16 nm. Different numbers of ssDNA per nanoparticle allow to fine-tune the distance. The change of the radiative and nonradiative molecular decay rates with distance is determined using time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. Remarkably, the distance dependent quantum efficiency is almost exclusively governed by the radiative rate.</abstract>

      <abstract>Phenomena that can be observed for a large number of molecules may not be understood if it is not possible to observe the events on the single-molecule level. We measured the fluorescence lifetimes of individual tetramethylrhodamine molecules, linked to an 18-mer deoxyribonucleotide sequence specific for M13 DNA, by time-resolved, single-photon counting in a confocal fluorescence microscope during Brownian motion in solution. When many molecules were observed, a biexponential fluorescence decay was observed with equal amplitudes. However, on the single-molecule level, the fraction of one of the amplitudes spanned from 0 to unity for a collection of single-molecule detections. Further analysis by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy made on many molecules revealed a process that obeys a stretched exponential relaxation law. These facts, combined with previous evidence of the quenching effect of guanosine on rhodamines, indicate that the tetramethylrhodamine molecule senses conformational transitions as it associates and dissociates to a guanosine-rich area. Thus, our results reveal conformational transitions in a single molecule in solution under conditions that are relevant for biological processes.</abstract>

      <abstract>A recently developed, real-time spectroscopic technique, burst-integrated fluorescence lifetime (BIFL), is shown to be well suited for monitoring the individual molecular conformational dynamics of a single molecule diffusing through the microscopic, open measurement volume (10 fl) of a confocal epi-illuminated set-up. In a highly diluted aqueous solution of 20-mer oligonucleotide strand of DNA duplex labeled with the environment-sensitive fluorescent dye tetramethylrhodamine (TMR), fluorescence bursts indicating traces of individual molecules are registered and further subjected to selective burst analysis. The two-dimensional BIFL data allow the identification and detection of different temporally resolved conformational states. A complementary autocorrelation analysis was performed on the time-dependent fluctuations in fluorescence lifetime and intensity. The consistent results strongly support the hypothesized three-state model of the conformational dynamics of the TMR-DNA duplex with a polar, a nonpolar, and a quenching environment of TMR.</abstract>

      <abstract>The photostability of fluorescent dyes is of crucial importance for the statistical accuracy of single-molecule detection (SMD) and for the image quality of scanning confocal microscopy. Concurrent results for the photostability were obtained by two different experimental techniques. First, the photostabilities of several coumarin and rhodamine derivatives in aqueous solution were obtained by monitoring the steady-state fluorescence decay in a quartz cell. Furthermore, an epi-illuminated microscope, continuous wave (CW) excitation at 514.5 nm, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with a newly developed theory were used to study the photobleaching characteristics of rhodamines under conditions used for SMD. Depending on the rhodamine structure, the probability of photobleaching, pb, is in the order of 10-6-10-7 for irradiances below 103 W/cm2. However, a considerable increase of pb for irradiances above this level was observed which can only be described by photobleaching reactions from higher excited states (two-step photolysis). In view of these observations, the probability of photobleaching, pb, as well as a closed expression of its dependence on the CW excitation irradiance considering a five-level molecular electronic state model with the possibility of photobleaching from higher excited electronic states, is derived. From this model, optimal conditions for SMD with respect to the number of emitted fluorescence photons and to the signal-to-background ratio are discussed, taking into account both saturation and photobleaching. The additional photobleaching due to two-step photolysis limits the applicable irradiance.</abstract>

      <abstract>The nonradiative lifetime of excited states near a small ( &lt;  2 nm) metal particle is investigated within a purely electromagnetic model. The excited state is described as a point dipole, and the metal particle is characterized by its self-consistently obtained nonlocal density-density correlation function. Resonant coupling, between excited states of adsorbates and various electronic excitations of the metal particle, is shown to be an important lifetime-determining decay channel.</abstract>

      <abstract>The highly sensitive nature of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy and surface plasmon field-enhanced fluorescence spectroscopy (SPFS) are governed by the strong surface plasmon resonance-generated evanescent field at the metal/dielectric interface. The greatest evanescent field amplitude at the interface and the maximum attenuation of the reflectance are observed when a nonabsorbing dielectric is employed. An absorbing dielectric decreases the evanescent field enhancement at the interface. The SPR curve of an absorbing dielectric is characterized by a greater reflectance minimum and a broader curve, as compared to those of the nonabsorbing dielectric with the same refractive index. For a weakly absorbing dielectric, such as nanometer-thick surface-confined fluorophores, the absorption is too small to induce a significant change in the SPR curve. However, the presence of a minute amount of the fluorophore can be detected by the highly sensitive SPFS. The angle with the maximum fluorescence intensity of an SPFS curve is always smaller than the resonance angle of the corresponding SPR curve. This discrepancy is due to the differences of evanescent field distributions and their decay characteristics within the metal film and the dielectric medium. The fluorescence intensity in an SPFS curve can be expressed in terms of the evanescent field amplitude. Excellent correlations between the experimentally measured fluorescence intensities and the evanescent field amplitudes are observed.</abstract>

      <abstract>A highly selective, colorimetric polynucleotide detection method based on mercaptoalkyloligonucleotide-modified gold nanoparticle probes is reported. Introduction of a single-stranded target oligonucleotide (30 bases) into a solution containing the appropriate probes resulted in the formation of a polymeric network of nanoparticles with a concomitant red-to-pinkish/purple color change. Hybridization was facilitated by freezing and thawing of the solutions, and the denaturation of these hybrid materials showed transition temperatures over a narrow range that allowed differentiation of a variety of imperfect targets. Transfer of the hybridization mixture to a reverse-phase silica plate resulted in a blue color upon drying that could be detected visually. The unoptimized system can detect about 10 femtomoles of an oligonucleotide.</abstract>

      <abstract>A theoretical study is presented on the fluorescence excitation and emission of a molecule embedded within a nanometric metal-coated dielectric bead. It occurs that, for favorable values of bead radius and metal layer thickness, photostability of the molecule is improved significantly, due to a dramatic decrease of the fluorescence lifetime caused by the strong electromagnetic interaction between the emitting molecule and the metal layer. Moreover, the metal shell enhances the exciting electric field intensity leading to an increase in fluorescence brightness by more than one order of magnitude.</abstract>

      <abstract>FT Raman spectra of avidin, streptavidin, and of the two anhydrous biotin complexes were obtained by excitation in near infrared (NIR). As far as avidin and the avidin-biotin complex are concerned, the excitation in NIR did not change the main features of the spectra compared with those previously obtained by visible excitation. However, the intensity of Trp bands did not change due to the formation of the complex when excited by NIR excitation, whereas an intensity increase was observed by 514 nm excitation. The percentages of secondary structure of the two proteins and the biotin complexes were obtained from the Raman spectra. The vibrational results indicate that as a consequence of the interaction with biotin, the percentages of &amp;bgr;-sheet conformation of the proteins decrease whereas the percentages of &amp;agr;-helix conformation increase. The observed changes of the conformation of streptavidin induced by biotin interaction are comparable with those obtained with avidin; this fact confirms that the type of the binding should be similar for the two molecules. Moreover, as a result of the biotin binding, the hydrophobicity of the environment of the Trp residues of streptavidin slightly increases according to the increase in intensity of the 1360 cm-1 component. This result could suggest that the streptavidin-biotin complex is stabilized mainly by hydrophobic interactions. © 1996 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</abstract>

      <abstract>Gold nanoparticles quench the fluorescence of cationic polyfluorene with Stern-Volmer constants (KSV) approaching 1011 M-1, several orders of magnitude larger than any previously reported conjugated polymer-quencher pair and 9-10 orders of magnitude larger than small molecule dye-quencher pairs. The dependence of KSV on ionic strength, charge and conjugation length of the polymer, and the dimensions (and thus optical properties) of the nanoparticles suggests that three factors account for this extraordinary efficiency: (i) amplification of the quenching via rapid internal energy or electron transfer, (ii) electrostatic interactions between the cationic polymer and anionic nanoparticles, and (iii) the ability of gold nanoparticles to quench via efficient energy transfer. As a result of this extraordinarily high KSV, quenching can be observed even at subpicomolar concentrations of nanoparticles, suggesting that the combination of conjugated polymers with these nanomaterials can potentially lead to improved sensitivity in optical biosensors.</abstract>

      <abstract>The interaction of a single quantum dot with a bowtie antenna is demonstrated for visible light. The antenna is generated at the apex of a Si3N4 atomic force microscopy tip by focused ion beam milling. When scanned over the quantum dot, its photoluminescence is enhanced while its excited-state lifetime is decreased. Our observations demonstrate that the relaxation channels of a single quantum emitter can be controlled by coupling to an efficiently radiating metallic nanoantenna.</abstract>

      <abstract>There is a striking disparity between the heart-shaped structure of human serum albumin (HSA) observed in single crystals and the elongated ellipsoid model used for decades to interpret the protein solution hydrodynamics at neutral pH. These two contrasting views could be reconciled if the protein were flexible enough to change its conformation in solution from that found in the crystal. To investigate this possibility we recorded the rotational motions in real time of an erythrosin-bovine serum albumin complex (Er-BSA) over an extended time range, using phosphorescence depolarization techniques. These measurements are consistent with the absence of independent motions of large protein segments in solution, in the time range from nanoseconds to fractions of milliseconds, and give a single rotational correlation time [phi](BSA, 1 cP, 20degreesC) = 40 +/- 2 ns. In addition, we report a detailed analysis of the protein hydrodynamics based on two bead-modeling methods. In the first, BSA was modeled as a triangular prismatic shell with optimized dimensions of 84 x 84 x 84 x 31.5 A, whereas in the second, the atomic-level structure of HSA obtained from crystallographic data was used to build a much more refined rough-shell model. In both cases, the predicted and experimental rotational diffusion rate and other hydrodynamic parameters were in good agreement. Therefore, the overall conformation in neutral solution of BSA, as of HSA, should be rigid, in the sense indicated above, and very similar to the heart-shaped structure observed in HSA crystals.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present measurements of photoluminescence decay dynamics from single colloidal CdSe quantum dots. We find that the decays fluctuate in time with decay rates that correlate with time-averaged emission intensities. Moreover, the decays measured by selecting only those photons collected while the single quantum dot emission intensity was near its maximum yields single-exponential dynamics. We find that the "maximum-intensity" decays are nearly identical across different independently synthesized samples of nearly the same size. The combination of single-exponential kinetics and decays that are reproducible across samples leads us to speculate that it is the radiative lifetime that is measured and that the quantum yield of a single dot near its maximum emission intensity is close to unity. The variations in decay rates with time and their correlation with emission intensity indicate these intensity time trajectories primarily reflect fluctuations in nonradiative relaxation pathways.</abstract>

      <abstract>Raman spectroscopy has been employed for the first time to study the role of adsorption at electrodes. It has been possible to distinguish two types of pyridine adsorption at a silver electrode. The variation in intensity and frequency of some of the bands with potential in the region of the point of zero charge has given further evidence as to the structure of the electrical double layer; it is shown that the interaction of adsorbed pyridine and water must be taken into account.</abstract>

      <abstract>The electromagnetic effects on a molecule near a metal surface are considered with the view to understanding the surface-enhanced-Raman-scattering (SERS) effect. The image enhancement effect is calculated including the nonlocal response of the metal and finite molecular size. The effect is much reduced (× 10^?5) from that for a point molecule above a local metal but can still give a gain ? 10^3. The power emitted by a dipole above a smooth surface is also calculated. For an Ag surface the power emitted in the form of photons, surface plasmons, and electron-hole excitations are found to be in the ratio 1 : 3 : 10^6. The numerical results are calculated using the semi-classical infinite-barrier model of the metal surface with a Lindhard dielectric function modified to take into account finite electron lifetime and core polarization.</abstract>

      <abstract>Despite the well-known relationship between the resonance Raman excitation profile and the absorption line shape, there is scant experimental evidence for effects in absorption or fluorescence spectroscopy related to the observations of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). On the other hand, numerous Raman studies have been done on the SERS phenomenon, where large enhancement factors have been determined. In this work, the absorption properties of molecules adsorbed on single gold and silver nanoparticles (monomers) have been investigated, with particular emphasis on an examination of the effect on the spectrum of the adsorbate. A number of the adsorbates studied are similar to those reported in SERS studies. The adsorbates can be divided into two classes according to the nature of the interaction with the adsorbent. Class I shows little change in the absorption spectrum. Class II shows a large reduction in absorption. The only examples of an increase in absorption arise from solvatochromic effects. The implication of these observations for the mechanism of SERS is discussed.</abstract>

      <abstract>Previous thermodynamic and computational studies have pointed to the important energetic role of aromatic contacts in generating the exceptional binding free energy of streptavidin-biotin association. We report here the crystallographic characterization of single site tryptophan mutants in investigating structural consequences of alterations in these aromatic contacts. Four tryptophan residues, Trp79, Trp92, Trp108 and Trp120, play an important role in the hydrophobic binding contributions, which along with a hydrogen bonding network and a flexible binding loop give rise to tight ligand binding (Ka 1013M-1). The crystal structures of ligand-free and biotin-bound mutants, W79F, W108F, W120F and W120A, in the resolution range from 1.9 to 2.3 A were determined. Nine data sets for these four different mutants were collected, and structural models were refined to R-values ranging from 0.15 to 0.20. The major question addressed here is how these mutations influence the streptavidin binding site and in particular how they affect the binding mode of biotin in the complex. The overall folding of streptavidin was not significantly altered in any of the tryptophan mutants. With one exception, only minor deviations in the unbound structures were observed. In one crystal form of unbound W79F, there is a coupled shift in the side-chains of Phe29 and Tyr43 toward the mutation site, although in a different crystal form these shifts are not observed. In the bound structures, the orientation of biotin in the binding pocket was not significantly altered in the mutant complex. Compared with the wild-type streptavidin-biotin complex, there were no additional crystallographic water molecules observed for any of the mutants in the binding pocket. These structural studies thus suggest that the thermodynamic alterations can be attributed to the local alterations in binding residue composition, rather than a rearrangement of binding site architectures.</abstract>

      <abstract>The streptavidin-biotin complex provides the basis for many important biotechnological applications and is an interesting model system for studying high-affinity protein-ligand interactions. We report here crystallographic studies elucidating the conformation of the flexible binding loop of streptavidin (residues 45 to 52) in the unbound and bound forms. The crystal structures of unbound streptavidin have been determined in two monoclinic crystal forms. The binding loop generally adopts an open conformation in the unbound species. In one subunit of one crystal form, the flexible loop adopts the closed conformation and an analysis of packing interactions suggests that protein-protein contacts stabilize the closed loop conformation. In the other crystal form all loops adopt an open conformation. Co-crystallization of streptavidin and biotin resulted in two additional, different crystal forms, with ligand bound in all four binding sites of the first crystal form and biotin bound in only two subunits in a second. The major change associated with binding of biotin is the closure of the surface loop incorporating residues 45 to 52. Residues 49 to 52 display a 3(10) helical conformation in unbound subunits of our structures as opposed to the disordered loops observed in other structure determinations of streptavidin. In addition, the open conformation is stabilized by a beta-sheet hydrogen bond between residues 45 and 52, which cannot occur in the closed conformation. The 3(10) helix is observed in nearly all unbound subunits of both the co-crystallized and ligand-free structures. An analysis of the temperature factors of the binding loop regions suggests that the mobility of the closed loops in the complexed structures is lower than in the open loops of the ligand-free structures. The two biotin bound subunits in the tetramer found in the MONO b1 crystal form are those that contribute Trp 120 across their respective binding pockets, suggesting a structural link between these binding sites in the tetramer. However, there are no obvious signatures of binding site communication observed upon ligand binding, such as quaternary structure changes or shifts in the region of Trp 120. These studies demonstrate that while crystallographic packing interactions can stabilize both the open and closed forms of the flexible loop, in their absence the loop is open in the unbound state and closed in the presence of biotin. If present in solution, the helical structure in the open loop conformation could moderate the entropic penalty associated with biotin binding by contributing an order-to-disorder component to the loop closure.</abstract>

      <abstract>A series of monodisperse colloidal Au aqueous suspensions, each containing spherical Au particles with a characteristic diameter (d), were prepared by heating 50 ml of aqueous HAuCl4 (10-2%) to boiling, adding varying amts. (c) of aqueous Na3 citrate (1%) to the boiling solution, and then boiling the resulting solution until the reduction of HAuCl4 was complete (30 min). During the reaction, the solns. 1st turned faintly blue in color after tb sec when nucleation occurred, and, after tr sec, the color suddenly changed again when the monodisperse sol particles were formed. The values of c (in ml), d (in {\AA}), tb (in sec), and tr (in sec) resp., for several of the monodisperse Au sols. were: orange sol, 1.00, 160, 25, 145; red sol, 0.50, 410, 25, 70; dark red sol, 0.30, 715, 40, 140; violet sol, 0.16, 1470, 80, 850. The resulting d values were determined by the number of nuclei over which the available Au was divided; the d value was not a result of the reduction of a different percentage of the available Au with different citrate concns.</abstract>

Statistics from TEM analysis showed a high yield of designed structures. The distance between Au particles and QD, the number of Au around the central QD, and the size of Au and QD can be adjusted. Rationally designed structures such as these hold great promise for researching the physical interactions between semiconductor and Au nanoparticles and for developing more efficient nanoprobes.</abstract>

      <abstract>The multipolar response of a small metallic sphere is studied with use of a nonlocal dielectric function. Results obtained with the hydrodynamic and Lindhard-Mermin models are presented and compared to those given by the local Drude model. We find an enhancement of the imaginary part of the multipole polarizabilities at low frequencies and pole order l&lt;lc, where lc is a cutoff order that corresponds to excitations at the high-wave-vector edge of the electron-hole pair continuum. The absorption coefficient for two very close spheres is calculated and the effect of nonlocality on the number and position of the multipolar absorption peaks is discussed.</abstract>

      <abstract>After a historical review of previous research into cooperative scattering, a theoretical investigation of the effects of interparticle coupling on morphology-dependent resonances of spheres is conducted. Bispheres composed of identical, slightly dissimilar, and very different monomers are considered. Calculations are presented of resonance spectra for selected orientations of the bispheres relative to the incident wave vector along with spectra that should prove useful in describing the scattering properties of a monodisperse ensemble of randomly oriented bispheres. (The bispheres in this dispersion may be constituted from dissimilar monomers.) Normalized source functions for regions inside and near the scatterers are also provided. Finally a numerical simulation of an interesting experiment is carried out in which a resonating aerosol passes through the focal volume of a relatively large, spherical microlens.</abstract>

      <abstract>An enormous SERS (Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering) signal from dye and adenine on hot or blinking silver nanoparticles is extinguished by duration of measurement possibly due to thermal diffusion or desorption of adsorbed molecules. Simultaneously, the elastic scattering peak at ca. 630 nm disappears. The Three-dimensional Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD-3D) method manifests this scattering peak as originating from enhanced coupling of localized surface plasmon (LSP) on adjacent Ag particles through absorption of adspecies located at their junction. Distinct emission peaks were observed at 550-600 nm and 600-750 nm. Based on the spectral variations for different surface coverage and for different dye species, the shorter and longer wavelength peaks were attributed to excited electrons on metal, and from fluorescence of molecules, respectively. Furthermore, we found the shorter wavelength peak shows invariant Stokes shift irrespective of excitation wavelengths, indicating it arises from inelastic scattering of excited electron by surface roughness or by adsorbed molecules.</abstract>

      <abstract>The blinking of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signal was observed for Ag touching particles with an extremely small number of molecules progressively extinguished in 10-30 min probably because of thermal diffusion to marginal sites from the junction or complete desorption of adsorbates. Interestingly, we found a significant change in elastic scattering spectra observed with a white light source during the inactivation process of SERS. Furthermore, it turned out exploiting numerical simulations for the local electric field and scattering spectra that such spectral changes result from the distinct electromagnetic coupling between the localized surface plasmon (LSP) and absorption of dye according to the on/off features of SERS activity. This is induced by thermal diffusion of individual molecules in and out of the junctions in accordance with the experimental observations on the vast enhancement in SERS. Thus, the critical importance of the junctions of Ag particles was confirmed concerning the origin of the blinking and mechanism of the enormous enhancement in SERS.</abstract>

      <abstract>Substantial increases in fluorescence emission from fluorophore-protein-coated fractal-like silver structures have been observed. We review two methods for silver fractal structure preparation, which have been employed and studied. The first, a roughened silver electrode, typically yielded a 100-fold increase in fluorophore emission, and the second, silver fractal-like structures grown on glass between two silver electrodes, produced a [ap]500-fold increase. In addition, significant increases in probe photostability were observed for probes coated on the silver fractal like structures. These results further serve to compliment our recent work on the effects of nobel metal particles with fluorophores, a relatively new phenomenon in fluorescence we have termed both 'metal-enhanced fluorescence' [1] and 'radiative decay engineering' [2,3]. These results are explained by the metallic surfaces modifying the radiative decay rate ([Gamma]) of the fluorescent labels. We believe that this new silver-surface preparation, which results in ultrabright and photostable fluorophores, offers a new generic technology platform for increased fluorescence signal levels, with widespread potential applications to the analytical sciences, imaging, and medical diagnostics.</abstract>

      <abstract>The interactions of fluorophores with noble metal particles can modify their emission spectral properties, a relatively new phenomenon in fluorescence. We subsequently examined indocyanine green (ICG), which is widely used in medical testing and imaging, in close proximity to an electrically roughened platinum electrode. The emission intensity and lifetimes were decreased about 2-fold on the roughened surface as compared to a smooth Pt surface, and the photostability about the same. Platinum does not appear promising for metal enhanced fluorescence, at least for long wavelength fluorophores.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this report we show the possibility of broadband low-pass filters with windows of transparency in pre-set spectral ranges. Those filters are based on the unique optical properties of metal-dielectric composites near the percolation threshold. In such composites, metal clusters of different sizes and shapes have different plasmon resonances and resonate nearly independently at different wavelengths. All together, the resonant plasmon modes cover a very broad spectral range. Applying the effect of spectrally selective photo-modification, we develop a procedure that creates mid-infrared windows of transparency within the broadband filters. We also investigate the possibilities of making low-pass filters composed of spheroids and conductive sticks with certain distributions of aspect ratios.</abstract>

      <abstract>We have studied the effect of the long-range amplification of secondary radiation of the molecules of oxazine 1 adsorbed on the surface of thin silver film covered by 1?7 Langmuir monolayers of stearic acid. We show that the intensity of the giant Raman scattering (GRS) changes proportionally to r-1 with removal of a molecule from the surface of a metal, which is in good agreement with the theory. The distances over which the strength of the electric field enhanced by the surface makes a substantial contribution to the processes mentioned are of the order of 10 nm.</abstract>

      <abstract>The optical response of molecucules adsorbed at or near interfaces are known to be strongly modified relative to those of the free molecules. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering is the most prominent example, however practically all molecular optical properties are affected. In this paper we review the electromagnetic theory of these phenomena with particular emphasis on resonance processes. We discuss lifetimes of excited molecular states, absorption, resonance Raman and fluorescence cross-sections, light scattering and emission yields, energy transfer between adsorbed molecules and photochemical processes. The electromagnetic theory of these phenomena incorporates the surface effect on the local electromagnetic field intensity with the surface-induced radiative and nonradiative decay rates to give working expressions for cross-sections, rates and yields of surface optical processes in terms of the incident beam direction, polarization and frequency, geometry and optical properties of the substrate and its environment and of the optical properties, location and orientation (relative to the substrate) of the adsorbed molecule. Available experimental results are in good qualitative or semiquantitative agreement with the theory. In addition we consider the role of cavity sites in surface-enhanced optical processes. We discuss two models for cavity sites, the conical wedge and enclosures between small particles. The latter are shown to be associated with particularly large enhancements both of the local field intensity and of the surface-induced radiative and nonradiative decay rates. Finally we dwell on the optical properties of small molecular particles which, near the molecular resonance, may give rise to strong local field enhancement provided that the molecules respond coherently to the incident radiation field. We show that the overall response depends on the rate of dephasing processes, which act to drive molecules out of phase with each other. The actual enhancements depend on this rate and on the particle size and shape.</abstract>

      <abstract>Gold nanoparticles of variable sizes have been exploited to study their influence on the emission behavior of methylamino derivative of pyrene. The probe molecules adsorbed onto the metallic surfaces suffer strong quenching of their fluorescence and the rate of quenching efficiency with particle size is different for two different size regimes. The size regime dependence of the particles on the fluorescence quenching process have been rationalized in view of the dependence of surface area on the size of the particles. The mechanism of fluorescence quenching on the gold surfaces has been treated in the light of electron and energy-transfer processes.</abstract>

      <abstract>The development of near-field optics theory is reviewed. We first recall that near-field optics is not limited to near-field microscopy. Broadly speaking, it concerns phenomena involving evanescent electromagnetic waves. The importance of such waves was ignored for a long time in optical and surface physics until the emergence of scanning near-field optical microscopes. Taking evanescent waves into account prevents the use of any simple approximation in the set of Maxwell's equations. The various theoretical approaches of near-field optics are discussed from the point of view of their ability to assess evanescent electromagnetic waves. We discuss the main results of the application of the various practical schemes which all rely on a numerical procedure. This review was received in February 1996.</abstract>

      <abstract>The electromagnetic interactions between a molecule and a spherical metal particle affect the linear response of the molecule. We present a general method to calculate the effective dynamic polarizability of such physisorbed systems by including the nonlocal character of the electron response in the sphere. Our model takes into account several long-range mechanisms connected to the dispersion, induction and local field effects. When the sphere reduces to a single atom, we recover results already known for a pair of atoms.</abstract>

      <abstract>The present study describes a new application of ruthenium(II) tris(bipyridine) (Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)) and osmium(II) tris(bipyridine) (Os(bpy)(3)(2+)) as phosphorescent labels for the quantification of surface binding of molecules to gold and silver nanoparticles. The fraction of Rtt(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) that is in solution can be distinguished from the surface-bound fraction by the relative lifetimes and integrated emission yields as determined by time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) spectroscopy. Complementary steady-state measurements were carried out to confirm surface attachment of the phosphorescent label molecules. Although the emission of solutions of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and Os(bpy)(3)(2+) is quenched proportional to the concentration of 10 nm Au or 20 nm Ag nanoparticles, the quenching is static and not diffusional quenching observed in Stern-Volmer plots. The results demonstrate that time-resolved spectroscopy provides a rapid method for the measurement of surface binding of labeled molecules on metallic nanoparticles. While steady-state measurements require the preparation of a series of samples with varying quencher concentrations and a reference, the method described herein requires a single sample plus reference. The mechanism for phosphorescence quenching on Au and Ag nanoparticles is discussed in terms of energy and electron transfer theories.</abstract>

With Q-factors as high as 109 the florescence could be extracted in a controlled way via a prism coupler. We observed nearly 100 which reflects the coupling to the WGMs. With the help of a beam scanning confocal microscope we were able to address a single 500 nm sized dye-doped bead on the sphere's surface and to collect and analyze its florescence in a well defined manner via the prism coupler.</summary>

      <abstract>We report herein biotin-streptavidin-mediated aggregation studies of long gold nanorods. We have previously demonstrated end-to-end linkages of gold nanorods driven by the biotin-streptavidin interaction (Caswell et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003, 125, 13914). In that report, the specific binding of biotin disulfide to the gold nanorod edges was achieved due to the preferred binding of thiol molecules to the Au111 surface (gold nanorod ends) as opposed to the gold nanorod side faces. This led to the end-end linkage of gold nanorods upon subsequent addition of streptavidin. In this report we demonstrate a simple procedure to biotinylate the entire gold nanorod surface and subsequently form a 3-D assembly by addition of streptavidin. Gold nanorods were synthesized by the three-step seeding protocol documented in our previous articles. The surface of gold nanorods was further modified by a layer of a weak polyelectrolyte, poly(acrylic acid), PAA. A biotin molecule which has an amine group at one end (biotin-PEO-amine) was anchored to the carboxylic acid group of the polyelectrolyte using the well-known carbodiimide chemistry. This process biotinylates the entire gold nanorod surface. Addition of streptavidin further leads to aggregation of gold nanorods. A closer look at the aggregates reveals a preferential side-to-side assembly of gold nanorods. The gold nanorods were characterized at each stage by UV-vis spectroscopy, light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, the fabrication, characterization, and application of unique layer-by-layer (LBL) films of dendrimers and metallic nanoparticles is reported. Silver nanoparticles (d =  20 nm) are produced in solution by sodium citrate reduction and incorporated into thin films with generation 1 and 5 DAB-Am dendrimers (polypropylenimine dendrimers with amino surface groups) by the LBL technique. The resulting nanocomposite films are characterized by UV-visible surface plasmon absorption and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements, and employed as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of 2-naphthalenethiol. Through variation of the molecular size (dendrimer generation) and concentration of the cross-linker used, as well as the number of layers produced, the optical properties of several different possible architectures are studied. In the films, Ag nanoparticles are shown to be effectively immobilized and stabilized with increased control over their spacing and aggregation. Moreover, the films are shown to be excellent substrates for SERS measurements, demonstrating significant enhancement capability. As expected, large electromagnetic enhancement of Raman scattering signals is found to be strongly dependent on interparticle coupling between neighboring metallic nanoparticles. Finally, the possibility of detecting SERS signals from architectures with intervening layers between the metal nanoparticles and analyte molecules is explored. It is shown that although there are decreases in intensity with increasing number of intervening layers (as is expected from the distance dependence of SERS), electromagnetic enhancement is still able to function at these distances, thus offering the possibility of developing sensors with external layers that are chemically selective for specific analytes.</abstract>

      <abstract>The mechanisms of energy and spin transfer in quantum dot pairs coupled via the Coulomb interaction are studied. Exciton transfer can be resonant or phonon-assisted. In both cases, the transfer rates strongly depend on the resonance conditions. The spin selection rules in the transfer process come from the exchange and spin-orbit interactions. The character of energy dissipation in spin transfer is different than that in the traditional spin currents. The spin-dependent photon cross-correlation functions reflect the exciton transfer process. In addition, a mathematical method to calculate Förster transfer in crystalline nanostructures beyond the dipole-dipole approximation is described.</abstract>

      <abstract>We describe a mechanism of spin transfer between individual quantum dots without tunneling. Incident circularly polarized photons create interband excitons with nonzero electron spin in the first quantum dot. When the quantum-dot pair is properly designed, this excitation can be transferred to the neighboring dot via the Coulomb interaction with conservation or flipping of electron spin. The second dot can radiate circularly polarized photons at smaller energy. Selection rules for spin transfer are determined by the resonant conditions and by the strong spin-orbit interaction in the valence band of nanocrystals. Coulomb-induced energy and spin transfer in pairs and chains of dots can become very efficient under resonant conditions. The electron can preserve its spin orientation even in randomly oriented nanocrystals.</abstract>

      <abstract>We describe the physical properties of excitons in hybrid complexes composed of semiconductor and metal nanoparticles. The interaction between individual nanoparticles is revealed as an enhancement or suppression of emission. Enhanced emission comes from electric field amplified by the plasmon resonance, whereas emission suppression is a result of energy transfer from semiconductor to metal nanoparticles. The emission intensity and energy transfer rate depend strongly on the geometrical parameters of the superstructure and the physical and material properties of the nanoparticles. In particular, the emission enhancement effect appears for nanoparticles with relatively small quantum yield, and silver nanoparticles have stronger enhancement compared to gold ones. Using realistic models, we review and analyze available experimental data on energy transfer between nanoparticles. In hybrid superstructures conjugated with polymer linkers, optical emission is sensitive to environmental parameters such as, for example, temperature. This sensitivity comes from expansion or contraction of a linker. With increasing temperature, emission of polymer-conjugated complexes can decrease or increase depending on the organization of a superstructure. The structures described here have potential as sensors and actuators.</abstract>

      <abstract>The design and initial characterization of two-dimensional arrays of colloidal Au particles are reported. These surfaces are prepared by self-assembly of 12 nn diameter colloidal Au particles onto immobilized polymers having pendant functional groups with high affinity for Au (i.e., CN, SH, and NH2). The polymers are formed by condensation of functionalized alkoxysilanes onto cleaned quartz, glass, and SiO2 surfaces. The assembly protocol is carried out completely in solution: cleaned substrates are immersed in methanolic solutions of organosilane, rinsed, and subsequently immersed in aqueous colloidal Au solutions. Two-dimensional arrays spontaneously form on the polymer surface, The resulting substrates have been characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). TEM data show that the particles are spatially separated but close enough to interact electromagnetically (small spacing compared to lambda). The UV-vis data show that collective particle surface plasmon modes are present in the 650-750 nm region, suggesting that these assemblies are SERS-active. This is indeed the case, with enhancement factors of roughly 10(4). Au colloid monolayers possess a set of features that make them very attractive for both basic and applied uses, including uniform roughness, high stability, and biocompatibility.</abstract>

      <abstract>The optical properties of plasmon resonant metallic nanoparticles are of great interest because of their ability to both control optical fields on the nanometer scale and function as sensitive indicators of their local environment. We investigate the relationship between the dielectric function of a metal and the optical properties of the constituent nanoparticle. Using a Drude shell?silica core nanoshell geometry, we examine how systematic changes in the parameters of the Drude dielectric function affect the near and far field properties of the nanoparticle. The nanoshell geometry allows separation of intrinsic properties and extrinsic phase retardation, or finite size, effects.</abstract>

      <abstract>The secondary structure of bovine serum albumin (BSA) is determined from infrared spectra (cast films, solution in phosphate buffer) by analyzing the structure of Amide bands. Due to strong overlapping of intrinsic bands three classical methods of band decomposition was implemented: Fourier self deconvolution, second derivatives and band fitting algorithm. The initial values for the number of the components and their position was checked with a novel procedure of dry and hydrated H/D exchange. The most dominant band component in Amide I region is the band at 1654 cm-1, which is usually attributed to a-helical structure. Other bands in Amide I region are attributed to various type of turns. Hydration of protein, as well as the solvation of protein in phosphate buffer, induces the radical change in the secondary structure, especially in the population of a-helices. Drying of the protein film causes a partial denaturation. Classical methods for determine the changes in secondary structure are not accurate enough. Moreover, the interpretation of changes can be easily misleading. Hence, the difference spectroscopy was used to clarify the effects of hydration and solvation on the protein secondary structure. The solvated protein was measured in ATR cell. For proper compare the ATR spectrum with the normal transmission one, first optical constant n and k were calculated and later the exact absorption spectrum.</abstract>

      <abstract>Aqueous solutions of Au colloids (12 ± 4 nm size) when treated with a blend of mono- and dithiols aggregate forming stable clusters, as evidenced by the shift of their surface plasmon (SP) band from 512 to ca. 600 nm. The presence of carboxylate ester functions on the dithiol allows its cleavage by addition of a cleaving agent, such as hydrazine. The cleavage process results in the breaking down of the clusters of nanoparticles and the shift of the SP band back to lower wavelengths. Further addition of dithiol causes the formation of the clusters again. The aggregation/deaggregation process may be monitored visually by following the color change from pink-red to purple and vice versa in the forward and backward steps, respectively.</abstract>

Double-stranded DNA is used as a rigid spacer to tune the distance between the two nanoparticles. The width of the fluorescent intensity distribution, monitored at different interparticle distances, reflects both the nanoparticle heterogeneity and the fluorescence intermittency of the quantum dot. The fluorescence distribution emitted by single CdSe nanocrystals can easily be distinguished from the fluorescence of partially quenched CdSe. Our results show that the distance-dependence quenching is compatible with a Förster-type process.</abstract>

      <abstract>A very general theory for the infrared absorption spectrum of homogeneous sphere clusters is presented. Maxwell's equations are solved for any arbitrary cluster geometry and for any light (polarized or not) incidence by usual expansion of the various fields. Usual boundary conditions are used but take into account the possible existence of plasmons in the spheres. High-order multipolar (electric and magnetic) interaction effects are included. The problem is cast into the calculation of the microscopic effective dielectric and magnetic susceptibility for the spheres, and that of the appropriate interaction terms. The latter (which constitute the hardest part of the theory in general) are calculated by formulating in a very practical way a recurrence relation for spherical vector wave functions in different reference frames. The extinction cross section is derived for any arbitrary case in order to allow for comparison of experimental data and previous theoretical work. The theory in the absence of any high-order polar effect is applied to the case of metallic clusters, e.g., small sodium spheres. Effects due to size distribution, sphere separation, and sphere magnetic permittivity are analyzed. Different light incidences are considered. A very brief discussion of the experimental status is presented for the case of metallic spheres. New experiments are suggested for which the theory is easily read out. Appendices contain new relations between Legendre functions and "spherical coupling parameters" allowing one to treat up to (24,24) polar-order interactions.</abstract>

      <abstract>We model the hybridization kinetics of surface attached DNA oligomers with solubilized targets. Using both master equation and rate equation formalisms, we show that, for surface coverages at which the surface immobilized molecules interact, barriers to penetration create a distribution of target molecule concentrations within the adsorbed layer. By approximately enumerating probe and target conformations, we estimate the probability of overlap between complementary probe and target regions as a function of probe density and chain length. In agreement with experiments, we find that as probe molecules interact more strongly, fewer nucleation sites become accessible and binding rates are diminished relative to those in solution. Nucleation sites near the grafted end of the probes are least accessible; thus targets which preferentially bind to this region show more drastic rate reductions than those that bind near the free end of the probe. The implications of these results for DNA-based biosensors are discussed.</abstract>

Its gold core is 1.4 nm in diameter and the Fab'-Au1.4nm immunoconjugate is the smallest gold immunoprobe that can be seen directly in the conventional electron microscope. It is useful in high- resolution immunolabeling, providing a resolution of 7.0 nm. The cluster's visibility can be enhanced with silver development for use in EM or light microscopy for histological purposes, or to detect less than or equal to 0.2 pg of antigen in immunoblots. By using a gold compound with covalent attachment, a number of advantages over colloidal gold probes are realized, including better resolution, stability, uniformity, sensitivity, and complete absence of aggregation; its small size should also improve penetration and more quantitative labeling of antigenic sites.</abstract>

      <abstract>Recent advances in gold technology have led to probes with improved properties and performance for cell biologists: higher labeling density, better sensitivity, and greater penetration into tissues. Gold clusters, such as the 1.4-nm Nanogold, are gold compounds that can be covalently linked to Fab' antibody fragments, making small and stable probes. Silver enhancement then makes these small gold particles easily visible by EM, LM, and directly by eye. Another advance is the combination of fluorescent and gold probes for correlative microscopy. Chemical crosslinking of gold particles to many biologically active molecules has made possible many novel probes, such as gold?lipids, gold?Ni?NTA, and gold?ATP.</abstract>

      <abstract>We demonstrate the separation of gold and silver nanoparticles according to their size and shape by agarose gel electrophoresis after coating them with a charged polymer layer. The separation is monitored optically using the size- and shape-dependent plasmon resonance of noble metal particles and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Electrophoretic mobilities are quantitatively explained by a model based on the Henry formula, providing a theoretical framework for predicting gel mobilities of polymer coated nanoparticles.</abstract>

      <abstract>This articles discusses the emergence of a field of atomic physics and quantum optics called cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). In addition to demonstrating dramatic changes in spontaneous emission, cavity QED has led to the creation of new kinds of microscopic masers that operate with a single atom and a few photons or with photons emitted in pairs in a two-photon transition. The influence of boundary conditions on atomic radiation was pointed out long ago, and a considerable body of literature exists on the subject. Until recently, however, experimental evidence for these effects had been scarce because of the difficulties of preparing, controlling and observing the emission of isolated atoms or molecules near surfaces. Just as a cavity below cutoff suppresses vacuum fluctuations, a resonance cavity enhances them. In addition to changing the radiation rate of atoms, atom-cavity coupling also includes energy shifts. This phenomenon can be understood as a frequency-pulling effect t</abstract>

      <abstract>We introduce a method of dye fluorescence excitation and measurement that utilizes a near-field scanning optical microscope (NSOM). This NSOM uses an apertureless metallic probe, and an optical system that contains a high numerical aperture (NA) objective lens (NA = 1.4). When the area which satisfies NA &lt; 1 is masked, the objective lens allows for the rejection of possible transmitted light (NA &lt; 1) through the sample. In such conditions, the focused spot consists of only the evanescent field. We found that this NSOM system strongly reduces the background of the dye fluorescence and allows for the measurement of the fluorescence intensity below the diffraction limit of the excitation source.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper reviews the recent progress in using single quantum systems, here mainly single fluorescent molecules, as local probes for nano-optical field distributions. We start by discussing the role of the absorption cross-section for the spatial resolution attainable in such experiments and its behaviour for different environmental conditions. It is shown that the spatial distribution of field components in a high-numerical aperture laser focus can be mapped with high precision using single fluorescent molecules embedded in a thin polymer film on glass. With this proof-of-principle experiment as a starting point, the possibility of mapping strongly confined and enhanced nano-optical fields close to material structures, e.g. sharp metal tips, is discussed. The mapping of the spatial distribution of the enhanced field at an etched gold tip using a single molecule is presented as an example. Energy transfer effects and quenching are identified as possible artefacts in this context. Finally, it is demonstrated that the local quenching at a sharp metal structure nevertheless can be exploited as a novel contrast mechanism for ultrahigh-resolution optical microscopy with single-molecule sensitivity.</abstract>

      <abstract>We demonstrate that commercially available unmodified carbocyanine dyes such as Cy5 (usually excited at 633 nm) can be used as efficient reversible single-molecule optical switch, whose fluorescent state after apparent photobleaching can be restored at room temperature upon irradiation at shorter wavelengths. Ensemble photobleaching and recovery experiments of Cy5 in aqueous solution irradiating first at 633 nm, then at 337, 488, or 532 nm, demonstrate that restoration of absorption and fluorescence strongly depends on efficient oxygen removal and the addition of the triplet quencher -mercaptoethylamine. Single-molecule fluorescence experiments show that individual immobilized Cy5 molecules can be switched optically in milliseconds by applying alternating excitation at 633 and 488 nm between a fluorescent and nonfluorescent state up to 100 times with a reliability of &gt;90% at room temperature. Because of their intriguing performance, carbocyanine dyes volunteer as a simple alternative for ultrahigh-density optical data storage. Measurements on single donor/acceptor (tetramethylrhodamine/Cy5) labeled oligonucleotides point out that the described light-driven switching behavior imposes fundamental limitations on the use of carbocyanine dyes as energy transfer acceptors for the study of biological processes.</abstract>

      <abstract>Measurements of the nonlinear dispersion of chi(3) have been performed on the surface plasmon resonance of aqueous colloidal gold. An analysis of the observed dispersion has revealed that the T1 and T2 lifetimes for the plasmon excitation are extremely rapid (&lt;10-14 s) but the release of heat by the particle electron/thermal reservoir is slower (&gt;2 ps). Picosecond time-resolved transient grating experiments on the same gold sol and organic dye solutions have confirmed that the nonradiative thermal decay of the metal particles occurs on the time scale of tens of picoseconds. The application of these methods to the study of ultrafast nonradiative relaxation mechanisms in molecular systems is discussed.</abstract>

      <abstract>We report the alteration of visible spontaneous emission by atoms coupled to the degenerate modes of a confocal resonator. The partial emission rate into the resonator modes is enhanced by a factor of 19 when the resonator is tuned to the atomic transition frequency and inhibited by a factor of 42 when it is detuned. This results in a fractional increase of 1.6% and decrease of 0.5%, respectively, in the total spontaneous emission rate, which we verify by monitoring changes in the intensity of light emitted out the sides of the resonator as it is tuned.</abstract>

      <abstract>A three-dimensional crystal structure of the biotin-binding core of streptavidin has been determined at 3.1- angstrom resolution. The structure was analyzed from diffraction data measured at three wavelengths from a single crystal of the selenobiotinyl complex with streptavidin. Streptavidin is a tetramer with subunits arrayed in D2 symmetry. Each protomer is an 8-stranded beta -barrel with simple up-down topology. Biotin molecules are bound at one end of each barrel. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) procedures for macromolecular crystallography and provides a basis for detailed study of biotinavidin interactions.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present for the first time experimental evidence of fluorescence lifetime enhancement of organic chromophores attached to metal nanospheres via radiative decay engineering. The hybrid system (HS) was a modified "diconjugated" molecular probe, 4-acetamido-4'-maleimidylstilbene-2,2'-dithiol (AMDT), covalently bound to the surface of 5-nm-diameter Au nanospheres by its two sulfur atoms, at a distance d &lt; 1 nm and with its molecular axis parallel to the surface of the nanoparticle surface. We measured a fluorescence lifetime increase of a factor of 2 at room temperature (AMDT = (4.32 ± 0.10) ns and HS = (8.73 ± 0.23) ns) and a factor of 3.4 at 4.2 K (AMDT = (2.64 ± 0.07) ns and HS = (7.96 ± 0.14) ns). We also found that the fluorescence quantum yield of this hybrid system is not reduced, proof of a weak energy transfer between the molecular probe and the nanoparticle. These results demonstrate that a molecular dipole oriented parallel to the metal surface tends to be reduced by the coupling with its image.</abstract>

      <abstract>Incorrectness of the amino acid sequence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was suggested from the observed molecular weight of BSA obtained by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS). Lack of a tyrosine residue in the position of 156th was found rapidly, by the combination of frit-fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry/liquid chromatography (Frit-FAB LC/MS), automated Edman degradation and tandem mass spectrometry (MS). Then it turned out that BSA is composed of 583 amino acid residues, and that its average molecular weight is not 66267.1, and it is corrected to 66430.3. Moreover the amino acid sequence of the positions of 94th and 95th was corrected to -QE- by using automated Edman degradation method.</abstract>

      <abstract>The photochemistry of cyanine J-aggregates on the surface of colloidal Ag nanoparticles is reported. The photochemistry is initiated through ultrafast photoexcitation of the plasmon band in Ag nanoparticles, producing an enhanced near-field that interacts with the J-aggregate monolayer. Through transient absorption spectroscopy, we show that photoexcitation of the plasmon in Ag nanoparticles leads to exciton dynamics that differ strongly from J-aggregates alone or for J-aggregate monolayers on bulk metal surfaces. Specifically, charge-separated states with a lifetime of  300 ps between the J-aggregate and Ag colloid are formed. The reduction of the Ag nanoparticles is shown to be a multielectron process.</abstract>

      <abstract>Near-field scanning microscopy is a powerful approach to obtain topographic and spectroscopic characterization simultaneously for imaging biological and nanoscale systems. To achieve optical imaging at high spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit, aperture-less metallic scanning tips have been utilized to enhance the laser illumination local electromagnetic field at the apex of the scanning tips. In this paper, we discuss and review our work on combined fluorescence imaging with AFM-metallic tip enhancement, finite element method simulation of the tip enhancement, and their applications on AFM-tip enhanced fluorescence lifetime imaging (AFM-FLIM) and correlated AFM and FLIM imaging of the living cells.</abstract>

      <abstract>A near-field optical imaging approach is demonstrated for simultaneous topographic and spectroscopic imaging with spatial resolution beyond the optical diffraction limit. The method combines metallic-tip-based tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). The AFM metallic tip was formed by sputter coating a Si tapping mode tip with Au, in a way that forms a globular tip apex. Such tip apex generates high local electric field enhancement under laser illumination, which provides a strong electric-field interaction between the AFM tip and the fluorescent molecules under the tip. The tip perturbation of fluorescence gives the fluorescence lifetime changes that provide the AFM-FLIM imaging contrast. A finite element method simulation was used to further evaluate the electric near-field enhancement and electric field distribution originating from the metallic Au-coated AFM tapping-mode tip. We have demonstrated that spatially mapping the change in fluorescence lifetime and intensity is a promising approach to spectroscopic imaging at an AFM spatial resolution typically defined by the apex diameter of the AFM tips. The globular Au-coated AFM tip not only gives adequate spatial AFM tapping-mode imaging spatial resolution but also is "environmentally friendly" to soft samples, such as polymeric dye-labeled nanospheres and even biological specimens such as POPO-3 labeled DNA.</abstract>

      <abstract>Gold nanoparticles coated with stabilizing thiolate monolayers of N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine (tiopronin) and N, N-trimethyl(undecylmercapto)ammonium quench the fluorescence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ in aqueous solution. The tiopronin monolayer protected clusters (MPCs) exert energy-transfer quenching by both collisional quenching and by static quenching in electrostatic complexes formed between [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and the tiopronin carboxylate groups. The electrostatic binding is pH-dependent and can be released by addition of electrolyte (e.g., K+, Bu4N+, and Ca2+ salts, which are increasingly effective in the order given). The tiopronin MPC quenching of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ fluorescence follows Stern-Volmer relations for plots of Fo/F against MPC concentration and Fo/F against electrolyte concentration at constant MPC concentration. Quenching and electrolyte binding constants were derived. MPCs with average Au core diameters of 2.2 nm (average) exhibited quenching constants that are 20-fold larger than those for 1.8-nm diameter.</abstract>

      <abstract>Near-field coupling of a single gold nanoparticle (GNP) to a single fluorescent molecule is investigated here for varying separation d between the two. While the emission quantum efficiency of the coupled system generally decreases for d!0, a pronounced near-field enhancement is observed under certain conditions, partly outweighing the efficiency loss at small distances. We report on optimizing these conditions by varying the excitation field direction and the three-dimensional relative configuration between the GNP and the fluorophore. Furthermore, we examine how the sphere diameter, the surrounding medium, as well as the absorption and emission wavelengths of the molecular dipole influence the fluorescence yield. Our results are of high practical relevance for all GNP-mediated application fields such as fluorescence microscopy, scattering near-field optical microscopy, bioanalytics, and medical applications.</abstract>

      <abstract>Irradiation of nanoabsorbers with pico- and nanosecond laser pulses could result in thermal effects with a spatial confinement of less than 50 nm. Therefore absorbing nanoparticles may be used for creating controlled intracellular effects. Conjugates of colloidal gold and alkaline phosphatase (aP) are presented as a model system for investigating protein inactivation in the vicinity of strongly absorbing nanoparticles. aP was coupled either directly or via antibodies to 15 nm gold particles. These conjugates were irradiated with picosecond pulses emitted by a frequency doubled Nd:YLF laser. Denaturation was detected as a loss of protein function with the help of a fluorescence assay. Irradiation with 104 pulses resulted in the inactivation of aP at an irradiance of 50 mJ/cm2 per pulse when the protein was coupled directly to the particles. With similar irradiation parameters a significant inactivation of aP which was coupled not directly but via two antibodies to the gold, was not observed. This shows that inactivating proteins with nanoabsorbers under irradiation with picosecond laser pulses is possible with a high spatial confinement. However, from these experiments it is difficult to determine whether the aP was destroyed thermally or whether it was inactivated by a photochemical reaction. Therefore, further experiments are needed to elucidate the damage mechanisms.</abstract>

      <abstract>Porphyrin monolayer-modified gold clusters (three-dimensional system) have been prepared successfully. Their electrochemical and photophysical properties have been compared to those of the corresponding two-dimensional system of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of the porphyrin as well as the bis(porphyrin) disulfide reference in solutions. In particular, the time-resolved single-photon counting fluorescence studies have indicated that the undesirable quenching of the porphyrin excited singlet state via energy transfer to the gold surface of the three-dimensional system is much suppressed, as compared to the quenching of the porphyrin SAMs on the two-dimensional flat gold surface. Thus, the present systems have a variety of potential utility for development of the artificial photosynthetic materials, photocatalysts, and chemical and biochemical sensors using fluorescent chromophore-monolayer modified gold clusters.</abstract>

      <abstract>Three-dimensional porphyrin-monolayer-protected gold clusters with different chain lengths (MPCs) have been prepared to examine the structure and photophysical properties, in comparison with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of the porphyrins on a flat gold surface. The three-dimensional porphyrin MPCs exhibit electrochemical and photophysical properties that are much closer to those of a porphyrin reference compound in solution than those of two-dimensional porphyrin SAMs on the flat gold surface. The three-dimensional architectures of porphyrin MPCs with large surface area have improved the light-harvesting efficiency relative to the corresponding porphyrin SAM on the two-dimensional flat gold surface. Time-resolved single photon counting fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopic studies have demonstrated that undesirable quenching of the porphyrin excited singlet state via energy transfer to the gold surface of the three-dimensional MPCs is much suppressed, as compared to the quenching of the porphyrin SAMs on the two-dimensional flat gold surface. Both the quenching rate constants of the porphyrin excited singlet state by the surfaces of bulk gold and gold nanoclusters reveal weak chain length dependence of the energy transfer quenching.</abstract>

      <abstract>Disulfides, with a systematic series of alkyl spacers containing porphyrins at both terminals, were prepared to investigate the effect of the spacer length on the structure and photoelectrochemical properties of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of the porphyrins on a gold electrode. The structure of the SAMs was studied using ultraviolet (UV)-visible absorption spectroscopy in transmission mode, cyclic voltammetry, UV-visible ellipsometry, and fluorescence spectroscopy. These measurements showed that as the length of the spacers increases, the SAMs tend to form highly ordered structures on the gold electrodes. In addition, the structures of the monolayers vary depending on the even and odd number of the methylene spacers (n). From these measurements a porphyrin dimer model is proposed in that the two porphyrins take J-aggregate-like partially stacked structures in the monolayers. Photoelectrochemical studies were carried out in argon-saturated Na2SO4 aqueous solution containing methyl viologen as an electron carrier using the modified gold working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The quantum yield increases in a zigzag fashion with an increase in the spacer length up to n equals 6 and then starts decreasing slightly as the chain lengths become longer. A plausible explanation for the photocurrent trend comes from the following points: (i) there are two competitive deactivation pathways for the excited singlet state of the porphyrin dimer, i.e., the quenching by the electrode via energy transfer and by the electron carrier via electron transfer, (ii) the porphyrin aggregation enhances the rate of nonradiative pathway in the excited state, and (iii) the electron transfer rate from the gold electrode to the resulting porphyrin cation radical decreases with an increase of the spacer lengths. These results will provide basic information for the construction of molecular assembly with photoactive function on surface.</abstract>

      <abstract>Three different kinds of mixed self-assembled monolayers have been prepared to mimic photosynthetic energy and electron transfer on a gold surface. Pyrene and boron-dipyrrin were chosen as a light-harvesting model. The mixed self-assembled monolayers of pyrene (or boron-dipyrrin) and porphyrin (energy acceptor model) reveal photoinduced singlet-singlet energy transfer from the pyrene (or boron-dipyrrin) to the porphyrin on the gold surface. The boron-dipyrrin has also been combined with a reaction center model, ferrocene-porphyrin-fullerene triad, to construct integrated artificial photosynthetic assemblies on a gold electrode using mixed monolayers of the respective self-assembled unit. The mixed self-assembled monolayers on the gold electrode have established a cascade of photoinduced energy transfer and multistep electron transfer, leading to the production of photocurrent output with the highest quantum yield (50 ± 8 reported for photocurrent generation at monolayer-modified metal electrodes and across artificial membranes using donor-acceptor linked molecules. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the photoelectrochemical cell at 510 and 430 nm was determined as 0.6 and 1.6 example of an artificial photosynthetic system, which not only mimics light-harvesting and charge separation processes in photosynthesis but also acts as an efficient light-to-current converter in molecular devices.</abstract>

      <abstract>An electromagnetic theory for the light absorption by a cluster of metal spheres and the Raman scattering by a molecule adsorbed on it is presented, which takes into account the retardation effect exactly and is applicable to an arbitrary cluster size. The theory is applied to a two-sphere cluster of Ag and Au. It is shown that the absorption spectrum is doubly peaked and the maximum enhancement factor of the Raman intensity amounts to 10^7-10^8 when the distance between spheres is decreased. Absorption spectra of three- and four-sphere clusters are also calculated, which indicate that the essential features of the experimental observations are explained by the two-sphere cluster.</abstract>

      <abstract>We report the first spectroscopic demonstration of direct electron transfer between a gold nanoparticle and a surface-bound fluorophore induced by pulsed laser irradiation. Binding of pyrene thiol directly to the gold nanoparticle results in quenching of its singlet excited state. The suppression of S1-T1 intersystem crossing process as well as the formation of pyrene radical cation confirm the excited-state interaction between the metal nanoparticle and the surface-bound fluorophore. The charge separation is sustained for several microseconds before undergoing recombination.</abstract>

      <abstract>Polarization dependences of Rayleigh and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) were measured for individual Ag nanoparticles on which Rhodamine 6G molecules were adsorbed. It was found that the polarization dependencies of surface plasmon bands generated by the aggregation of SERS active Ag particles are well synchronous to those of Raman bands. This result strongly supports the recent electromagnetic SERS model that amplified electric field at particle junctions localized in the aggregate gives rise to SERS.</abstract>

      <abstract>The properties of materials can be created and improved either by confining their dimensions in the nanoscale or by controlling their nanostructure. {W}e have combined these two concepts, and here we describe a new class of nanostructured nanosized materials that show ordered phase-separated domains at an unprecedented molecular length scale. {S}canning tunnelling and transmission electron microscope images of monolayer-protected metal nanoparticles, with ligand shells composed of a mixture of molecules, show that the ligands phase-separate into ordered domains as small as 5 {\AA}. {I}mportantly, the domain shape and dimensions can be controlled by varying the ligand composition or the metallic core size. {W}e demonstrate that the formation of ordered domains depends on the curvature of the underlying substrate, and that novel properties result from this nanostructuring. {F}or example, because the size of the domains is much smaller than the typical dimensions of a protein, these materials are extremely effective in avoiding non-specific adsorption of a variety of proteins.</abstract>

      <abstract>It has been recently shown that the strength of plasmon coupling between a pair of plasmonic metal nanoparticles falls as a function of the interparticle gap scaled by the particle size with a near-exponential decay trend that is universally independent of nanoparticle size, shape, metal type, or medium dielectric constant. In this letter, we extend this universal scaling behavior to the dielectric core-metal shell nanostructure. By using extended Mie theory simulations of silica core-metal nanoshells, we show that when the shift of the nanoshell plasmon resonance wavelength scaled by the solid nanosphere resonance wavelength is plotted against the shell thickness scaled by the core radius, nanoshells with different dimensions (radii) exhibit the same near-exponential decay. Thus, the nanoshell system becomes physically analogous to the particle-pair system, i.e., the nanoshell plasmon resonance results from the coupling of the inner shell surface (cavity) and the outer shell surface (sphere) plasmons over a separation distance essentially given by the metal shell thickness, which is consistent with the plasmon hybridization model of Prodan, Halas, and Nordlander. By using the universal scaling behavior in the nanoshell system, we propose a simple expression for predicting the dipolar plasmon resonance of a silica-gold nanoshell of given dimensions.</abstract>

      <abstract>Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) in lithographically fabricated gold (Au) nanodisc pairs are investigated using microabsorption spectroscopy and electrodynamic simulations. In agreement with previous work, we find that the fractional plasmon wavelength shift for polarization along the interparticle axis decays nearly exponentially with the interparticle gap. In addition, we find that the decay length is roughly about 0.2 in units of the particle size for different nanoparticle size, shape, metal type, or medium dielectric constant. The near-exponential distance decay and the interesting "universal" scaling behavior of interparticle plasmon coupling can be qualitatively explained on the basis of a dipolar-coupling model as being due to the interplay of two factors: the direct dependence of the single-particle polarizability on the cubic power of the particle dimension and the decay of the plasmonic near-field as the cubic power of the inverse distance. Using this universal scaling behavior, we are able to derive a "plasmon ruler equation" that estimates the interparticle separation between Au nanospheres in a biological system from the observed fractional shift of the plasmon band. We find good agreement of the interparticle separations estimated using this equation with the experimental observations of Reinhard et al. (Nano Lett. 2005, 5, 2246-2252).</abstract>

      <abstract>In this work we have verified the remarkable sensitivity of Raman spectroscopy for the study of adsorbed pyridine on a silver surface, and extended its applicability to other nitrogen heterocycles and amines. New bands in the scattering spectrum of adsorbed pyridine have been characterized, which were not previously reported, as well as the Raman intensity response of all the surface pyridine bands as a function of electrode potential. As a result of these experiments, we have proposed a model of the adsorbed species for pyridine in which the adsorption is anion induced, leading to an axial end-on attachment to the electrode surface. The ability to obtain resonance Raman spectra with good signal-to-noise with laser powers less than 1.0 mW, reported here for the first time, opens up possibilities of surface Raman studies with relatively inexpensive laser systems. As laser power requirements are relaxed, reliability is improved, and greater tuning ranges can be achieved for wavelength dependent studies. We previously demonstrated the potential of resonance Raman spectroscopy for monitoring solution kinetic behavior [2], and now have shown that NR as well as RR spectroscopy has sufficient sensitivity to extend the studies of kinetic processes to include those occurring at electrode surfaces.</abstract>

      <abstract>The fluorescence behavior of molecular dyes at discrete distances from 1.5 nm diameter gold nanoparticles as a function of distance and energy is investigated. Photoluminescence and luminescence lifetime measurements both demonstrate quenching behavior consistent with 1/d4 separation distance from dye to the surface of the nanoparticle. In agreement with the model of Persson and Lang, all experimental data show that energy transfer to the metal surface is the dominant quenching mechanism, and the radiative rate is unchanged throughout the experiment.</abstract>

      <abstract>The fluorescence decay functions of individual, specifically labeled tRNAPhe molecules exhibit nonexponential character as a result of conformational dynamics occurring during the measurement on a single molecule. tRNAPhe conformational states that interchange much more slowly are evidenced by the distribution of lifetimes observed for many individual molecules. A structural model for the nonexponential decay indicates that the tRNAPhe-probe adduct fluctuates between two states, one of which provides conditions that quench the probe fluorescence.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present a general model study of surface-enhanced resonant Raman scattering and fluorescence, focusing on the interplay between electromagnetic (EM) effects and the molecular dynamics as treated by a density matrix calculation. The model molecule has two electronic levels, is affected by radiative and nonradiative damping mechanisms, and a Franck-Condon mechanism yields electron-vibration coupling. The coupling between the molecule and the electromagnetic field is enhanced by placing it between two Ag nanoparticles. The results show that the Raman scattering cross section can, for realistic parameter values, increase by some 10 orders of magnitude (to similar to 10(-14) cm(2)) compared with the free-space case. Also the fluorescence cross section grows with increasing EM enhancement, however, at a slower rate, and this increase eventually stalls when nonradiative decay processes become important. Finally, we find that anti-Stokes Raman scattering is possible with strong incident laser intensities similar to 1 mW/mu m(2).</abstract>

      <abstract>The optical constants n and k were obtained for the noble metals (copper, silver, and gold) from reflection and transmission measurements on vacuum-evaporated thin films at room temperature, in the spectral range 0.5-6.5 e{V}. {T}he film-thickness range was 185-500 {\AA}. {T}hree optical measurements were inverted to obtain the film thickness d as well as n and k. {T}he estimated error in d was ± 2 {\AA}, and that in n, k was less than 0.02 over most of the spectral range. {T}he results in the film-thickness range 250-500 {\AA} were independent of thickness, and were unchanged after vacuum annealing or aging in air. {T}he free-electron optical effective masses and relaxation times derived from the results in the near infrared agree satisfactorily with previous values. {T}he interband contribution to the imaginary part of the dielectric constant was obtained by subtracting the free-electron contribution. {S}ome recent theoretical calculations are compared with the results for copper and gold. {I}n addition, some other recent experiments are critically compared with our results.</abstract>

      <abstract>A combination of scanning and imaging surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments is used to characterize DNA hybridization adsorption at gold surfaces and the subsequent immobilization of streptavidin. Single-stranded oligonucleotides are immobilized at gold surfaces, and the hybridization of biotinylated complements from solution is monitored with SPR. The subsequent attachment of streptavidin to the biotinylated complements provides a method of enhancing the SPR imaging signal produced as a result of the hybridization and leads to a 4-fold improvement in the hybridization detection limit of the SPR imaging apparatus. In situ scanning SPR experiments are used to measure a 60 ± 20% hybridization efficiency between immobilized single-stranded DNA and biotinylated complements. From the information provided by both the in situ imaging and scanning SPR experiments, an absolute surface coverage of immobilized single-stranded DNA is estimated to be  3 × 1012 molecules/cm2. The SPR signal resulting from hybridization onto immobilized probes is further amplified by the formation of streptavidin/DNA multilayers which grow by a combination of DNA hybridization and biotin-streptavidin binding. DNA/DNA multilayers without streptavidin are used as an additional method of amplifying the SPR signal.</abstract>

      <abstract>We demonstrate a tomographic method for determining the degree of ellipticity and the orientation of a gold nanoparticle. To do this, we attach a single nanoparticle to the end of a sharp glass fiber tip and record its plasmon spectra for different incident polarizations and angles of incidence. Our measurements allow us to identify the plasmon spectra along the three main axes of the particle, therefore resolving its "internal" spectral inhomogeneity. Knowledge of the plasmon resonances and the orientation of a metallic nanoparticle is an important asset for controlled and quantitative studies of its interaction with a single molecule.</abstract>

Particles with diameters of 100 nm have been successfully and reproducibly mounted at the end of sharp glass fibre tips. We present the first optical images taken with such a probe. We have also recorded plasmon resonances of gold particles and discuss schemes for exploiting the wavelength dependence of their scattering cross-section for a novel form of apertureless scanning near-field optical microscopy.</abstract>

      <abstract>Unique electronic and chemical properties of metal nanoparticles have drawn the attention of chemists, physicists, biologists, and engineers who wish to use them for the development of new generation nanodevices. Metal nanoparticles such as gold and silver show noticeable photoactivity under UV-visible irradiation as is evident from the photoinduced fusion and fragmentation processes. Binding a photoactive molecule (e.g., pyrene) to metal nanoparticle enhances the photochemical activity and renders the organic-inorganic hybrid nanoassemblies suitable for light-harvesting and optoelectronic applications. The nature of charge-transfer interaction of fluorophore with gold surface dictates the pathways with which the excited-state deactivates. Obtaining insight into energy and electron-transfer processes is important to improve the charge separation efficiencies in metal-fluorophore nanoassemblies and photocatalytic activity of metal-semiconductor composites.</abstract>

      <abstract>Nanomaterials, such as metal or semiconductor nanoparticles and nanorods, exhibit similar dimensions to those of biomolecules, such as proteins (enzymes, antigens, antibodies) or DNA. The integration of nanoparticles, which exhibit unique electronic, photonic, and catalytic properties, with biomaterials, which display unique recognition, catalytic, and inhibition properties, yields novel hybrid nanobiomaterials of synergetic properties and functions. This review describes recent advances in the synthesis of biomolecule-nanoparticle/nanorod hybrid systems and the application of such assemblies in the generation of 2D and 3D ordered structures in solutions and on surfaces. Particular emphasis is directed to the use of biomolecule-nanoparticle (metallic or semiconductive) assemblies for bioanalytical applications and for the fabrication of bioelectronic devices.</abstract>

      <abstract>Titin, a giant filamentous polypeptide, is believed to play a fundamental role in maintaining sarcomeric structural integrity and developing what is known as passive force in muscle. Measurements of the force required to stretch a single molecule revealed that titin behaves as a highly nonlinear entropic spring. The molecule unfolds in a high-force transition beginning at 20 to 30 piconewtons and refolds in a low-force transition at  2.5 piconewtons. A fraction of the molecule (5 to 40 percent) remains permanently unfolded, behaving as a wormlike chain with a persistence length (a measure of the chain's bending rigidity) of 20 angstroms. Force hysteresis arises from a difference between the unfolding and refolding kinetics of the molecule relative to the stretch and release rates in the experiments, respectively. Scaling the molecular data up to sarcomeric dimensions reproduced many features of the passive force versus extension curve of muscle fibers.</abstract>

      <abstract>The optical properties of metal nanoparticles have long been of interest in physical chemistry, starting with Faraday's investigations of colloidal gold in the middle 1800s. More recently, new lithographic techniques as well as improvements to classical wet chemistry methods have made it possible to synthesize noble metal nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes, shapes, and dielectric environments. In this feature article, we describe recent progress in the theory of nanoparticle optical properties, particularly methods for solving Maxwell's equations for light scattering from particles of arbitrary shape in a complex environment. Included is a description of the qualitative features of dipole and quadrupole plasmon resonances for spherical particles; a discussion of analytical and numerical methods for calculating extinction and scattering cross-sections, local fields, and other optical properties for nonspherical particles; and a survey of applications to problems of recent interest involving triangular silver particles and related shapes.</abstract>

      <abstract>A model for Raman scattering by a molecule adsorbed at the surface of a spherical particle is articulated by treating the molecule as a classical electric dipole. This follows Moskovits's suggestion [J. Chem. Phys. 69, 4159 (1978)] and the experiments by Creighton et al. [J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. II, 75, 790 (1979)] that such a system may exhibit SERS similar to that at roughened electrode surfaces. The molecule is stimulated by a primary field comprised of the incident and near-scattered fields. Emission consists of the dipole field plus a scattered field, each at the shifted frequency. Addition of feedback terms between the dipole and the particle makes only a negligible contribution to the fields. For pyridine adsorbed at the surface of a silver sphere, the 1010-cm-1 band is enhanced by -106 if the radius is much less than the wavelengths and the excitation wavelength is -382 nm, a wavelength for which the relative refractive index of silver is close to m = \/2i. Detailed results are given for the effect upon the angular distribution and the polarization of the Raman emission of particle size, distance from the surface, excitation wavelength, and location of the molecule upon the surface. These results simulate those observed at roughened silver electrodes and suggest that the mechanism of SERS at those electrodes may resemble the electromagnetic mechanism elucidated here. We predict that comparable effects should be observed for fluorescent scattering.</abstract>

      <abstract>The size of gold nanoparticle aggregates was controlled by manipulating the interparticle interaction. To manipulate the interparticle interaction of gold nanoparticles prepared by citrate reduction, we applied the substitutive adsorption of benzyl mercaptan on the particle surface in the absence of the cross-linking effect. Various experimental techniques such as UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, quasi-elastic light scattering, and zeta-potential measurement were used to characterize the nanoparticle aggregates. Our results suggest that the replacement of the trivalent citrate ions adsorbed on the nanoparticle surface with monovalent benzyl mercaptan ions should destabilize the particles, causing aggregation and hence the increase in the size of nanoparticle aggregates. These experimental results were successfully rationalized by the classical DLVO (Derjaguin-Landau-Vervey-Overbeek) theory that describes the interparticle interaction and colloidal stability in solution. Our findings suggest that the control of surface potential is crucial in the design of stable gold nanoparticle aggre</abstract>

      <abstract>A comprehensive treatment of the classical decay rates for a molecule in the vicinity of a spherical surface is presented through the application of the work of van der Pol and Bremmer and that of Fock. This theory takes full advantage of the Hertz vector formalism, which is mathematically simpler than the widely-adapted Lorenz-Mie approach which uses the complicated vector harmonic expansions. Results are obtained for both radiative and nonradiative transfer when the molecule is located outside or inside the surface. Numerical results are given for the cases of a surface, cavity and aerosol, and comparison with other works is made.</abstract>

      <abstract>It is known that in the decay rate spectrum for molecules near a spherical surface, an extra morphology-dependent resonance structure appears in addition to the usual surface plasmon resonance ($\omega_{sp}\approx{\omega_p}^{\mathrm{bulk}}/\sqrt{3}$). {H}ere an alternative but more physical interpretation of these peaks is given, where it is seen that the morphology-dependent peak can be described only in a dynamic retarded theory.</abstract>

      <abstract>Using a near-field optical antenna effect, we measure the homogeneous line shape of the surface-plasmon resonance in single gold nanoparticles. The surface-plasmon dephasing times extracted from the near-field spectra of the individual particles vary around 8 fs. This mean value agrees with calculations based on Mie theory, which neglect surface effects. Deviations of individual particles from this value are interpreted as being due to variations in the local nanoenvironment. We also observe double-peaked line shapes caused by electromagnetic coupling between close-lying particles.</abstract>

      <abstract>The radiative properties of an atom in a cavity differ fundamentally from the atom's radiative properties in free space. Spontaneous emission is inhibited if the cavity has characteristic dimensions which are small compared to the radiation wavelength, and enhanced if the cavity is resonant. The cavity causes slight shifts in the energies of the atom, analogous to radiative shifts. Experiments are proposed for observing these effects.</abstract>

In addition to its own detection by the characteristic ICG SERS signatures, the ICG gold nanoprobe delivers spatially localized chemical information from its biological environment by employing SERS in the local optical fields of the gold nanoparticles. The probe offers the potential to increase the spectral specificity and selectivity of current chemical characterization approaches of living cells and biomaterials based on vibrational information.</abstract>

      <abstract>Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a spectroscopic technique which combines modern laser spectroscopy with the exciting optical properties of metallic nanostructures, resulting in strongly increased Raman signals when molecules are attached to nanometre-sized gold and silver structures. The effect provides the structural information content of Raman spectroscopy together with ultrasensitive detection limits, allowing Raman spectroscopy of single molecules. Since SERS takes place in the local fields of metallic nanostructures, the lateral resolution of the technique is determined by the confinement of the local fields, which can be two orders of magnitude better than the diffraction limit. Moreover, SERS is an analytical technique, which can give information on surface and interface processes. SERS opens up exciting opportunities in the field of biophysical and biomedical spectroscopy, where it provides ultrasensitive detection and characterization of biophysically/biomedically relevant molecules and processes as well as a vibrational spectroscopy with extremely high spatial resolution. The article briefly introduces the SERS effect and reviews contemporary SERS studies in biophysics/biochemistry and in life sciences. Potential and limitations of the technique are briefly discussed.</abstract>

      <abstract>Nonresonant Raman cross sections of 10^-16 cm2 per molecule are shown to be related to surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) on colloidal silver clusters at near-infrared (NIR) excitation. The enhancement is found to be independent of cluster sizes between 100 nm and 20 µm. These experimental findings demonstrate that NIR SERS on colloidal silver clusters is an excellent technique for single molecule detection that is applicable for a broad range of molecules including "colorless" biomolecules, for example nucleotides in DNA sequencing. As an example, we present the detection of a single adenine molecule without any labeling based on its intrinsic surface-enhanced Raman scattering.</abstract>

      <abstract>This Account discusses surface-enhanced Raman scattering at extremely high enhancement levels that can occur for molecules attached to silver and gold nanoclusters. Strongly enhanced and highly confined local optical fields enable surface-enhanced Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy of single molecules even under nonresonant excitation conditions as well as extremely large effective cross sections in two-photon excited Raman spectroscopy. The ability for very sensitive and spatially confined molecular structural probing makes gold and silver nanoclusters very promising tools for studies of small structures in biological materials, such as cellular compartments.</abstract>

      <abstract>In agreement with previous results reported for colloidal silver clusters, effective surface-enhanced Raman cross sections of about 10-(16) cm(2) per molecule, corresponding to enhancement factors on the order of 10(14), have also been obtained for molecules attached to colloidal gold clusters. Spatially isolated nearly spherical colloidal gold particles of about 60 nm size show maximum enhancement factors on the order of 10(3) at 514 nm excitation, close to the single plasmon resonance. The enhancement factor increases by eleven orders of magnitude when colloidal gold clusters are formed by aggregation of the gold colloids and when near-infrared excitation is applied. The large effective surface-enhanced Raman cross section has been estimated by a straightforward method based on steady-state population redistribution due to the pumping of molecules to the first excited vibrational state via the strongly enhanced Raman process. Our experimental finding confirms the important role of colloidal clusters for extremely large surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement factors. Simultaneously, it suggests colloidal gold clusters as a substrate for high-sensitivity surface-enhanced Raman scattering, which can provide an enhancement level sufficient for Raman single molecule detection. Due to its chemical inactivity, gold might have some advantages compared to silver, particularly in biomedical spectroscopy.</abstract>

      <abstract>We observed significant transfer of ground state population to the first excited vibrational state by spontaneous surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) which can be explained by unexpectedly large SERS cross sections. Evidence for this pumping includes (i) anti-Stokes to Stokes ratios which exceed those expected from a Boltzmann distribution, (ii) a quadratic dependence of the anti-Stokes signal on the excitation intensity, whereas the Stokes signal remains linearly dependent, and (iii) a component of nu = 1 to nu = 2 Raman transitions in the SERS Stokes signals.</abstract>

      <abstract>By exploiting the extremely large effective cross sections ( 10^-17 to 10^-16 cm2/molecule) available from surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), we achieved the first observation of single molecule Raman scattering. Measured spectra of a single crystal violet molecule in aqueous colloidal silver solution using one second collection time and about 2×10^5 W/cm2 nonresonant near-infrared excitation show a clear "fingerprint" of its Raman features between 700 and 1700 cm-1. Spectra observed in a time sequence for an average of 0.6 dye molecule in the probed volume exhibited the expected Poisson distribution for actually measuring 0, 1, 2, or 3 molecules.</abstract>

      <abstract>A method has been developed for highly sensitive detection of specific DNA sequences in a homogeneous assay using labeled oligonucleotide molecules in combination with single-molecule photon burst counting and identification. The fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides are called smart probes because they report the presence of complementary target sequences by a strong increase in fluorescence intensity. The smart probes consist of a fluorescent dye attached at the terminus of a hairpin oligonucleotide. The presented technique takes advantage of the fact that the used oxazine dye JA242 is efficiently quenched by complementary guanosine residues. Upon specific hybridization to the target DNA, the smart probe undergoes a conformational change that forces the fluorescent dye and the guanosine residues apart, thereby increasing the fluorescence intensity about six fold in ensemble measurements. To increase the detection sensitivity below the nanomolar range, a confocal fluorescence microscope was used to observe the fluorescence bursts from individual smart probes in the presence and absence of target DNA as they passed through the focused laser beam. Smart probes were excited by a pulsed diode laser emitting at 635 nm with a repetition rate of 64 MHz. Each fluorescence burst was identified by three independent parameters: (a) the burst size, (b) the burst duration, and (c) the fluorescence lifetime. Through the use of this multiparameter analysis, higher discrimination accuracies between smart probes and hybridized probe-target duplexes were achieved. The presented multiparameter detection technique permits the identification of picomolar target DNA concentrations in a homogeneous assay, i.e., the detection of specific DNA sequences in a 200-fold excess of labeled probe molecules.</abstract>

      <abstract>We show that a nanoparticle can serve as an efficient antenna for coupling of visible light into propagating plasmons of an Ag nanowire. For long wires, the coupling is maximal for incident light polarized perpendicular to the nanowire. For sub-10-m nanowires, the polarization corresponding to maximum emission from the ends of the nanowire was found to be strongly dependent on the nanowire geometry and position of the vicinal nanoparticle. This nanoparticle antenna-based approach offers a potential strategy for optimizing plasmon coupling into nanoscale metallic waveguides.</abstract>

      <abstract>Two procedures are presented which allow the homogeneous incorporation of silica-coated gold nanoparticles within transparent silica gels. Both UV-visible absorption spectra and transmission electron microscopy show that there is no aggregation of the metal particles during sol-gel transition. The optical properties of the gels are compared with those of the starting sols and interpreted on the basis of the porous structure of the gels and standard optical theories. Evidence is also shown of the potential of these methods for the preparation of gels with different particle sizes and shapes as well as with very high nanoparticle concentrations, which can be useful for several applications.</abstract>

      <abstract>Au, Ag, and Au/Ag colloidal nanoparticles coated with the J-aggregate of an anionic cyanine dye, 3,3'-disulfopropyl-5,5'-dichlorothiacyanine sodium salt (TC), have been prepared for the first time. The absorption spectrum of TC-coated Au colloidal nanoparticles is not a simple sum of the contributions of colloidal gold and TC but is characterized by an evident absorption dip at the position corresponding to the J-band of TC. These spectral features are reproduced by the simulation based on the Maxwell-Garnett-type treatment of Gao et al. The alternate adsorption technique allowed us to deposit dye-coated Au/Ag composite nanoparticles at the surface of a cationic polymer, poly(diallyldimethylammonium chroride).</abstract>

      <abstract>The optical near-field in the vicinity of a metal tip is mapped using a single-molecule optical probe. We observe an enhancement of the fluorescence signal by a factor of 5.7±0.3, clearly larger than the fourfold enhancement that can arise from constructive interference if the tip acts as a simple mirror. Considering the tip apex as a nanoparticle of nonregular shape, we suggest that, in the case of gold tips, the enhancement is due to resonant plasmon excitation. Consistently, no enhancement has been observed using Pt/Ir tips.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper reports two fundamental observations on the size-dependent optical properties of colloidal gold nanoparticles. First, faceted gold nanocrystals in the size range of 63 ± 3 nm have been found to be highly efficient for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). These nanocrystals are identified from a heterogeneous population for large optical enhancement at 647-nm laser excitation. Second, spatially isolated single gold particles emit Stokes-shifted Raman photons in an intermittent on-and-off fashion. In contrast to population-averaged studies, blinking surface-enhanced Raman scattering is a signature of single-particle (or even single-molecule) behavior. By directly measuring optical enhancement and time-resolved emission on single nanoparticles, this work opens new possibilities in studying the mechanisms of SERS, in developing metal tips for near-field optical microscopy, and in designing new nanostructured materials.</abstract>

      <abstract>The decay time of the luminescence of a molecule S in front of a metal mirror depends markedly on its distance from the mirror. This phenomenon is quantitatively explained by considering the radiation field of this dipole, given by Hertz classical equation. This field arrives at the molecule, after being reflected at the mirror, with a retardation of the order of 10-15 sec. The decay time of the luminescence depends on the phase shift produced by this retardation, and thus on the ratio of the distance of the oscillator from the mirror, and the wavelength of the emitted light. By measuring the distance dependence of the decay time of the luminescence this retardation effect can be studied. In quantum-mechanical terms the phenomenon can be described as being due to a stimulation or inhibition of the emission of the light quantum. In contrast to the known cases of stimulated emission, the stimulating field is the radiation field of the emitter quantum itself. The energy transfer from an excited molecule S to an acceptor A can be treated in a similar manner by considering the phenomenon as a retardation effect. In classical terms the field of S induces A to oscillate, and the induced field of A arriving at S slows down this oscillator. Simple equations are given for the energy transfer from an excited dipole or quadrupole, and for a row of many dipoles, oscillating in phase, to a weakly absorbing acceptor layer. The latter case is considered as a model for a J-aggregating dye and by comparison with experimental data conclusions concerning the size of a J aggregate are drawn.</abstract>

      <abstract>We have studied the enhancement of luminescence of (CdSe)ZnS core-shell quantum dots on gold colloids as a function of semiconductor nanocrystal-metal nanoparticle distance. Using a layer-by-layer polyelectrolyte deposition technique to insert well-defined spacer layers between gold colloids and quantum dots, a distance-dependent enhancement and quenching of quantum dot photoluminescence has been observed. The maximum enhancement by a factor of 5 is achieved for a 9-layer spacer (11 nm). The efficient quantum dot excitation within the locally enhanced electromagnetic field produced by the gold nanoparticles is evidenced by the observation of the surface plasmon resonance in the photoluminescence excitation spectrum of (CdSe)ZnS nanocrystals.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present a theoretical analysis of surface-enhanced Raman scattering and fluorescence emission from chromophoric molecules located at electromagnetic ?hot spots? in nanoparticle aggregates. The model combines classical electrodynamic enhancement effects with molecular quantum dynamics and allows us to quantify various molecular cross-sections and spectral properties. For a model molecule that simulates rhodamine 6G, we find that an electromagnetic Raman enhancement of the order of 1010 results in an effective Raman cross-section of the order of 10-14 cm2, in agreement with single-molecule Raman measurements.</abstract>

      <abstract>Metallic particles and surfaces display diverse and complex optical properties. Examples include the intense colors of noble metal colloids, surface plasmon resonance absorption by thin metal films, and quenching of excited fluorophores near the metal surfaces. Recently, the interactions of fluorophores with metallic particles and surfaces (metals) have been used to obtain increased fluorescence intensities, to develop assays based on fluorescence quenching by gold colloids, and to obtain directional radiation from fluorophores near thin metal films. For metal-enhanced fluorescence it is difficult to predict whether a particular metal structure, such as a colloid, fractal, or continuous surface, will quench or enhance fluorescence. In the present report we suggest how the effects of metals on fluorescence can be explained using a simple concept, based on radiating plasmons (RPs). The underlying physics may be complex but the concept is simple to understand. According to the RP model, the emission or quenching of a fluorophore near the metal can be predicted from the optical properties of the metal structures as calculated from electrodynamics, Mie theory, and/or Maxwell?s equations. For example, according to Mie theory and the size and shape of the particle, the extinction of metal colloids can be due to either absorption or scattering. Incident energy is dissipated by absorption. Far-field radiation is created by scattering. Based on our model small colloids are expected to quench fluorescence because absorption is dominant over scattering. Larger colloids are expected to enhance fluorescence because the scattering component is dominant over absorption. The ability of a metal?s surface to absorb or reflect light is due to wavenumber matching requirements at the metal?sample interface. Wavenumber matching considerations can also be used to predict whether fluorophores at a given distance from a continuous planar surface will be emitted or quenched. These considerations suggest that the so called ?lossy surface waves? which quench fluorescence are due to induced electron oscillations which cannot radiate to the far-field because wavevector matching is not possible. We suggest that the energy from the fluorophores thought to be lost by lossy surface waves can be recovered as emission by adjustment of the sample to allow wavevector matching. The RP model provides a rational approach for designing fluorophore?metal configurations with the desired emissive properties and a basis for nanophotonic fluorophore technology.</abstract>

      <abstract>We report recent achievements in metal-enhanced fluorescence from our laboratory. Several fluorophore systems have been studied on metal particle-coated surfaces and in colloid suspensions. In particular, we describe a distance dependent enhancement on silver island films (SIFs), release of self-quenching of fluorescence near silver particles, and the applications of fluorescence enhancement near metalized surfaces to bioassays. We discuss a number of methods for various shaped silver particle deposition on surfaces.</abstract>

      <abstract>Metallic surfaces can have unusual effects on fluorophores such as increasing or decreasing the rates of radiative decay and the rates of resonance energy transfer (RET). In the present article we describe the effects of metallic silver island films on the emission spectra, lifetimes, and energy transfer for several fluorophores. The fluorophores are not covalently coupled to the silver islands so that there are a range of fluorophore-to-metal distances. We show that proximity of fluorophores to the silver islands results in increased fluorescence intensity, with the largest enhancement for the lowest-quantum-yield fluorophores. Importantly, the metal-induced increases in intensity are accompanied by decreased lifetimes and increased photostability. These effects demonstrate that the silver islands have increased the radiative decay rates of the fluorophore. For solvent-sensitive fluorophores the emission spectra shifted to shorted wavelengths in the presence of the silver islands, which is consistent with a decrease of the apparent lifetime for fluorophores near the metal islands. We also observed an increased intensity and blue spectral shift for the protein human glyoxalase, which displays a low quantum yield for its intrinsic tryptophan emission. In this case the blue shift is thought to be due to increased emission from a buried low-quantum-yield tryptophan residue. Increased intensities were also observed for the intrinsic emission of the nucleic acid bases adenine and thymine and for single-stranded 15-mers poly(T) and poly(C). And finally, we observed increased RET for donors and acceptors in solution and when bound to double-helical DNA. These results demonstrate that metallic particles can be used to modify the emission from intrinsic and extrinsic fluorophores in biochemical systems.</abstract>

      <abstract>We consider a nanoscale dipolar emitter (quantum dot, atom, fluorescent molecule, or rare-earth ion) in a nanometer proximity to a flat metal surface. There is strong interaction of this emitter with unscreened metal electrons in the surface nanolayer that causes enhanced relaxation due to surface plasmon excitation and Landau damping. To describe these phenomena, we developed analytical theory based on local random-phase approximation. For the system considered, conventional theory based on metal as continuous dielectric fails both qualitatively and quantitatively. Applications of the present theory and related phenomena are discussed.</abstract>

      <abstract>Abstract: The optical responses of 75-150 nm diameter gold nanorings to changes in local refractive index have been quantified by near-infrared extinction spectroscopy and compared to DDA calculations and an analytical approach. The "bulk" refractive index sensitivities of gold nanorings are substantially (&gt;5 times) larger than those of nanodisks with similar diameters. Nanorings retain a significantly larger sensitivity than nanodisks at the same spectral position, demonstrating a clear shape dependence that may correlate to a systematic difference in the influence of the dielectric substrate. The nanoring bulk refractive index sensitivity scales linearly with plasmon peak position. The spectral sensitivity to thin films of alkanethiols gave a shift of  5.2 nm/CH2 unit while bulk sensitivities as high as 880 nm/RIU were observed, the highest such reported sensitivities. Both bulk and thin dielectric film sensitivities correlated well with theory. Real-time label-free monitoring of protein binding via molecular recognition was demonstrated.</abstract>

      <abstract>We address in this paper the long debated issue of the possibility of vibrational pumping under Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) conditions, both theoretically and experimentally. We revisit with simple theoretical models the mechanisms of vibrational pumping and its relation to heating. This presentation provides a clear classification of the various regimes of heating/ pumping, from simple global laser heating to selective pumping of a single vibrational mode. We also propose the possibility of extreme pumping driven by stimulated phonon emission, and we introduce and apply a new experimental technique to study these effects in SERS. Our method relies on correlations between Raman peak parameters, and cross-correlation for two Raman peaks. We find strong evidence for local and dynamical heating, but no convincing evidence for selective pumping under our specific experimental SERS conditions.</abstract>

      <abstract>Abstract: We study the importance of an often-overlooked aspect of surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF): the spectral profile modification (SPM) that should accompany any plasmon-resonance-mediated enhancement or quenching of the fluorescence close to metal surfaces. We argue theoretically and demonstrate experimentally that under SEF conditions the plasmon resonances affect not only the fluorescence intensity (enhancement or quenching) but also its spectral profile, sometimes to a point where the original fluorescence spectrum may no longer be recognizable as such. Moreover, we argue that the modified excited-state decay rate may, under certain conditions, become comparable to the internal relaxation rate. This effect leads to a new fluorescence mechanism, which we call fast-dynamics SEF (FDSEF), where the spectral profile is affected by the relaxation dynamics in the excited state (in addition to the plasmon resonance). Finally, we propose that the so-called surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) continuum may, in many instances, be interpreted in terms of a SPM of the SEF (in its simplest form or as FDSEF). Experimental evidence using highly uniform nanolithography-prepared gold nanostructures are provided to support these ideas.</abstract>

      <abstract>We provide the theoretical framework to understand the phenomenology and statistics of single molecule (SM) signals arising in surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) under the presence of so-called electromagnetic hot spots. We show that most characteristics of the SM-SERS phenomenon can be tracked down to the presence of a tail-like (power law) distribution of enhancements and we propose a specific model for it. We analyze, in the light of this, the phenomenology of SM-SERS and show how the different experimental manifestations of the effect reported in the literature can be analyzed and understood under a unified "universal" framework with a minimum set of parameters.

      <abstract>The linear absorption cross section is a crucial parameter to the design of nanocrystal quantum dot devices and to the interpretation of spectroscopic data. We measure and report the size-dependent absorption cross section of CdSe nanocrystal quantum dots. We compare the results for absorption far above the band edge, where the quantum dot density of states may be approximated as a continuum, to simple theoretical models of light scattering from light-absorbing small particles. Excellent agreement with theory is found for dilute dispersions in hexane. We find that for absorption at 350 nm the per particle absorption cross section C-abs (in cm(2)) for CdSe is C-abs = (5.501 x 10(5))a(3) cm(-1), where a is the particle radius in cm. The absorption cross section is observed to be largely insensitive to the solvent refractive index. Detailed modeling of the effect of the ligand shell may be necessary to understand the lack of sensitivity of the absorption properties of nanocrystal quantum dots to the refractive index of the medium.</abstract>

      <abstract>Langmuir isotherm is applied to analyze the laser-induced fluorescence from solutions containing silver nanoparticles and tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) chloride. Fluorescence enhancement factors based on the simple adsorption model are found to be 47-90, depending on the nanoparticle concentration. The enhancement is attributed to the laser-induced free-carrier absorption on the silver surfaces, which is a reverse saturable absorption process, at the excitation wavelength of 532 nm.</abstract>

      <abstract>Nanoscale superstructures made from CdTe nanowires (NWs) and metal nanoparticles (NPs) are prepared via bioconjugation reactions. Prototypical biomolecules, such as D-biotin and streptavidin pair, were utilized to connect NPs and NWs in solution. It was found that Au NPs form a dense shell around a CdTe NW. The superstructure demonstrated unusual optical effects related to the long-distance interaction of the semiconductor and noble metal nanocolloids. The NW-NP complex showed 5-fold enhancement of luminescence intensity and a blue shift of the emission peak as compared to unconjugated NW. The system was theoretically examined in a simple model of CdTe NW coaxially surrounded by an Au shell, which gives excellent agreement with experimental data. The combination of time-resolved luminescence and calculations demonstrated that increase of fluorescence intensity occurs due to stimulation of photon emission by an electromagnetic field generated around the Au NP. The process is reminiscent of SERS, although displaying smaller enhancement factors. Importantly, the luminescence enhancement should be treated as a collective response of Au-NPs, rather than a result of isolated NP-NW interactions.</abstract>

      <abstract>The fluorescent properties of dye molecules (rhodamine 6G and erythrosin) absorbed on pure glass surfaces and silver island films are investigated by cw and picosecond time-resolved methods. On pure glass surfaces we observe concentration quenching below a critical intermolecular distance (reduction of the fluorescence power per molecule as well as shortened and non-exponential fluorescence decay). On silver islands films the shortening in fluorescence lifetime is more drastic and is nearly independent of the intermolecular distance. This behaviour suggests an electrodynamic interaction between dye monomers and plasmons in metal particles, modified by a damping influence of dye dimers.</abstract>

      <abstract>A dynamical approach to the classical decay rates for molecules near a dielectric sphere is presented through the application of the diffraction theory for a dipole antenna established by Van del Pol and Bremmer. This theory is somewhat simpler than but formally equivalent to that established by Ruppin and preserves a feature which is closer to the method of the theory established by Chance, Prock, and Silbey for a flat surface. The results, when compared to those obtained from the static image theory, show that this latter theory can be very inaccurate for large molecule-sphere distances or highly conducting spheres, consistent with previous findings for surfaces with perfect flatness or small roughness.

      <abstract>The dynamics of photoinduced charge separation and charge recombination processes in synthetic DNA hairpins have been investigated by means of femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The driving force and distance dependence of charge-transfer processes involving singlet acceptors and nucleobase donors are consistent with a single-step superexchange mechanism in which the electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor is strongly distance dependent. The dynamics of reversible hole transport between a primary guanine donor and nearby GG or GGG sequences has also been determined and establishes that these sequences are very shallow hole traps.</abstract>

      <abstract>The distance dependence of photoinduced electron transfer in duplex DNA was determined for a family of synthetic DNA hairpins in which a stilbene dicarboxamide forms a bridge connecting two oligonucleotide arms. Investigation of the fluorescence and transient absorption spectra of these hairpins established that no photoinduced electron transfer occurs for a hairpin that has six deoxyadenosine-deoxythymidine base pairs. However, the introduction of a single deoxyguanosine-deoxycytidine base pair resulted in distance-dependent fluorescence quenching and the formation of the stilbene anion radical. Kinetic analysis suggests that duplex DNA is somewhat more effective than proteins as a medium for electron transfer but that it does not function as a molecular wire.</abstract>

      <abstract>In the present work a new dye, [Ru(dcbpyH2)2(bpy-TPA2)](PF6)2, and the well-known (Bu4N)2[Ru(dcbpyH)2(NCS)2] complex were investigated. The electronic transitions of both dyes showed solvatochromic shifts due to specific interactions of the ligands with the solvent molecules. The surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectra of the dyes dissolved in water, ethanol, and acetonitrile were measured in silver and gold colloidal solutions. The results demonstrate that the dyes were adsorbed on the metallic nanoparticles in different ways for different solvents. It was also found that in the gold colloid, the aqueous solutions of both dyes did not produce any SERS signal, whereas in ethanolic solution the SERS effect was very weak. Deprotonation, H-bonding, and donor-acceptor interactions seem to determine these different behaviors. Our results indicate the important role of the charge-transfer mechanism in SERS.</abstract>

      <abstract>Simple, fast, economical, and sensitive detection of specific DNA sequences is crucial to pathogen detection and biomedical research. We have designed a novel fluorescent assay for DNA hybridization based on the electrostatic properties of DNA. We exploit the ability to create conditions where single-stranded DNA adsorbs on negatively charged gold nanoparticles while double-stranded DNA does not. Dye-tagged probe sequences have their fluorescence efficiently quenched when they are mixed with gold nanoparticles unless they hybridize with components of the analyte. Subfemtomole amounts of untagged target are detected in minutes using commercially available materials. Target sequences in complex mixtures of DNA and single-base mismatches in DNA sequences are easily detected.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we had proposed a silicon integrated circuit (IC) compatible DNA-detection platform using photodiode and ordinary optical illumination to detect DNA hybridization events occurred on the chip surface. The method utilizes gold nanoparticle labeling and silver enhancement to generate opaque surface at area with target DNA hybridization. A photodiode fabricated underneath the supporting surface can then be used to detect the light intensity changes, before and after the silver enhancement. With this technique, we have successfully discriminated single base-mismatched DNA from matched DNA sequence, and the detection limit could be as low as 10 pM. By exploiting the advanced modern IC manufacturing technology and the well-established electrochemical immobilization of DNA, this approach has the potential to be used to construct a portable high-density DNA nanoarray system with fully electronic readout. &amp;COPY; 2004 Elsevier B.V.

      <abstract>As an efficient nanolens, we propose a self-similar linear chain of several metal nanospheres with progressively decreasing sizes and separations. To describe such systems, we develop the multipole spectral expansion method. Optically excited, such a nanolens develops the nanofocus ("hottest spot") in the gap between the smallest nanospheres, where the local fields are enhanced by orders of magnitude due to the multiplicative, cascade effect of its geometry and high Q factor of the surface plasmon resonance. The spectral maximum of the enhancement is in the near-ultraviolet region, shifting toward the red region as the separation between the spheres decreases. The proposed system can be used for nanooptical detection, Raman characterization, nonlinear spectroscopy, nanomanipulation of single molecules or nanoparticles, and other applications.</abstract>

      <abstract>The nanostructure of a metallic dimer, a pair of metallic (Au or Ag) nanoscatterers containing a molecule within its gap, is studied for the purpose of the enhancement of a single molecule's fluorescence due to the coupling surface plasmon resonance of the dimer. For simplicity, a two-dimensional transverse magnetic model is used for simulation, and a set of new surface integral equations is developed for the calculation of the electromagnetic field. The process of fluorescence is simply divided into two stages, the excitation and the emission, for analysis. For the former, an incident plane wave illuminating the structure to excite the molecule is simulated. For the latter, another model, an electric dipole within the gap of the dimer, is used to simulate the excited molecule interacting with the dimer. The results show that a metallic dimer behaves as a nanolens to provide a strong local electric field in the gap to excite the molecule, and its quantum yield behaves as a low-pass filter as well as an orientizer for the fluorescence emission.</abstract>

      <abstract>With the introduction of different quenching moieties in already existing rhodamine dyes we were able to develop new dyes with nearly identical absorption and emission characteristics but different fluorescent lifetimes and quantum yields, so called multiplex dyes. Optical excitation of the rhodamine chromophor induces an intramolecular electron transfer between the rhodamine subunit and the quenching molecule. As predicted by the classical theory of electron transfer we can control the rate of electron transfer by the distance between the donor and the acceptor, e.g. different coupling positions and spacers, and the polarity of the surrounding medium. We investigated the following quenchers: m-, o- and p-nitrobenzylamine, p-dimethylaminobenzylamine and p-methoxybenzylamine.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper describes the results of an investigation of the interparticle interactions and reactivities in the assembly of gold nanoparticles mediated by cyanine dyes. The combination of the positively charged indolenine cyanine dyes and the negatively charged gold nanoparticles is shown to form a J-aggregate bridged assembly of nanoparticles, in addition to hydrophobic interparticle and electrostatic dye-particle interactions. Such interparticle interactions and reactivities are studied by probing the absorption of J-aggregates and fluorescence from the dyes and the surface plasmon resonance absorption from the nanoparticles. The J-aggregation of the dyes adsorbed on the nanoparticles is shown to play an important role in the assembly of nanoparticles. The spectral evolution of the J-band of the dyes and the surface plasmon resonance band of the nanoparticles was found to be sensitive to the nature of the charge and the structure of the dyes. The fluorescence quenching for the dyes was shown to be quantitatively related to the surface coverage of the dyes on the nanocrystal surfaces. These findings have provided important information for assessing a two-step process involving a rapid adsorption of the dyes on the nanoparticles and a subsequent assembly of the nanoparticles involving a combination of interparticle J-aggregation and hydrophobic interactions of the adsorbed dyes. The results are discussed in terms of the structural effects of the dyes, and the interparticle molecular interactions and reactivities, which provide important physical and chemical insights into the design of dye-nanoparticle structured functional nanomaterials.</abstract>

      <abstract>The Raman Spectra of bovine serum albumin have been obtained in the solute state, in alkaline and acidic solutions, and in the gel. The reversible denaturations of bovine serum albumin solutions by heat, acid's, and alkali were studied and a new mechanism for heat denaturation has been proposed based on a continuous unfolding of the ?-helices.</abstract>

      <abstract>The luminescence properties of chemically prepared gold nanoclusters, each composed of a 28-atom core and a glutathione (GSH) adsorbate layer consisting of 16 molecules, were investigated. These clusters show a distinct absorption onset at 1.3 eV corresponding to the opening of an electronic gap within the conduction band (HOMO-LUMO gap). Here we report on the radiative properties of these molecular-like gold clusters. By using a combination of different detectors with sensitivities in the visible to the infrared (2.0-0.8 eV), a broad luminescence extending over this entire spectral range was observed. Our results further suggest that the luminescence can be separated into two bands with maxima around 1.5 and 1.15 eV indicating that radiative recombination between the ground state and two distinctively different excited states takes place. The origin of the observed luminescence bands is discussed using a solid state as well as a molecular model for the electronic structure and relaxation of the clusters. The total quantum yield of the luminescence as measured at ambient temperature was approximated to be about (3.5 ± 1.0) × 10-3.</abstract>

      <abstract>We report the first observation of third-harmonic signals from individual gold colloids down to 40 nm diameter. Excited with 1-ps pulses at 1500 nm, the colloids generate 500-nm light, close to the plasmon resonance. The third-harmonic intensity varies as the square of the colloid surface area. Although weak, the third-harmonic signals of gold labels as small as 15 nm in diameter are expected to be accessible with 100-fs pulses. They could be used in microscopy for single-biomolecule tracking.</abstract>

      <abstract>Planned nanopatterns of [Au55(Ph2PC6H4SO3Na)12Cl6] clusters are generated on smooth silicon surfaces using a "bottom-up" fabrication methodology based on the selective self-assembly of the gold clusters on purpose-designed organic template patterns themselves fabricated via a hierarchical layer-by-layer self-assembly strategy. The patterns are laterally defined by constructive nanolithography, a novel surface patterning process utilizing conductive AFM tips as nanoelectrochemical "pens", with which nanoscale chemical information is inscribed in a nondestructive manner (in the form of a localized chemical transformation) on the top surface of a highly ordered organosilane monolayer self-assembled on silicon. Development of the initial tip-imprinted information is achieved via further self-assembly and chemical derivatization steps. This generic all-chemical approach offers attractive options for the advancement of nanofabrication capabilities that might have real impact on future technologies.</abstract>

      <abstract>Herein, we report an efficient process for preparing monodisperse Au\SiO2 nanoparticles using homogeneous shaking and without the use of surface-coupling silane agents or large stabilizers. The resulting pure-silica surface of the Au\SiO2nanoparticles is very important for straightforward surface functionalization with different functional groups via well-established silica surface chemistry. {S}ubsequent covalent bioconjugation of the aldehyde-functionalized Au\SiO2 nanoparticles with various biomolecules is successfully employed to make robust nanoprobes for fast, colorimetric {DNA} and protein detection based on the sequence-specific hybridization properties of {DNA} and the specific binding affinity between proteins, respectively.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this work we shall develop a formalism which extends previous calculations of lifetimes of excited molecular states near planar dielectric surfaces and near single small dielectric particles to situations where the molecule is adsorbed on a cluster made of several dielectric spherical grains. The nonradiative relaxation rate is seen to be relatively weakly dependent on the cluster structure and, if the molecule is adsorbed on one of the grains, is well approximated by the single grain result. The radiative decay rate and hence the quantum yield are much more sensitive to the geometry of the cluster which determines the position (in frequency) of the dielectric resonances of the cluster. The formalism developed here may be used to evaluate local field intensities at different positions within a cluster of dielectric grains under the influence of an external incident field.

      <abstract>We present novel gold nanophotonic crescent moon structures with a sub-10 nm sharp edge, which can enhance local electromagnetic field at the edge area. The formation of unconventional nanophotonic crescent moon structure is accomplished by using a sacrificial nanosphere template and conventional thin film deposition method, which allows an effective batch nanofabrication and precise controls of nanostructure shapes. Unique multiple scattering peaks are observed in a single gold nanocrescent moon with dark-field white light illumination. A 785 nm near-infrared (NIR) diode laser was used as the excitation source to induce the amplified scattering field on the sharp edge of the single gold nanocrescent moon. The Raman scattering spectrum of Rhodamine 6G molecules adsorbed on the single gold nanocrescent moon are characterized, and the Raman enhancement factor of single gold nanocrescent moon is estimated larger than 10(10), which suggests the potential applications of gold nanocrescent moons in ultrasensitive biomolecular detection and cellular imaging using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy.</abstract>

      <abstract>We observed a strong, more than 16-fold, enhancement of Texas Red-labeled BSA fluorescence emission when deposited on silver colloid coated surfaces (SCCS). The same labeled protein deposited on silver island films (SIFs) showed an approximate 8-fold fluorescence enhancement. The lifetimes of Texas Red-BSA fluorescence are significantly shorter on silvered surfaces than on uncoated quartz substrate indicating a strong change in radiative decay rate of the dyes. We also observed a 36-fold increased brightness of overlabeled fluorescein-HSA deposited on silver colloid coated surface. Stronger enhancement observed for overlabeled Fl-HSA protein indicates that presence of silver particles partially decreased self-quenching. Our results indicate that surfaces coated with silver colloids are valuable substrates for metal-enhanced fluorescence.</abstract>

      <abstract>Absolute fluorescence quantum yields are reported for the rhodamine 6G cation and the fluorescein dianion dyes in nine solvents. This information is combined with previously reported fluorescence lifetimes to deduce radiative and nonradiative decay rates. Along the alcohol series from methanol to octanol, rhodamine 6G displays an increasing radiative rate, in parallel with the square of the refractive index increase, and a slightly decreasing nonradiative rate. Fluorescein is different: the apparent radiative rate actually decreases, suggesting that the emissive species is perturbed in some fashion. For both dyes, fluorescence yields are enhanced in D2O, rising to 0.98, in parallel with a corresponding increase in lifetimes. Protonated solvents invariably give shorter lifetimes and lower quantum yields, contrary to some previous speculation. From this work and an analysis of existing literature values, more precise values have been obtained for two previously proposed absolute quantum yield standards. The yield of fluorescein in 0.1 N NaOH(aq) is 0.925 +- 0.015, and for rhodamine 6G in ethanol, it is 0.950 +- 0.015. In both cases, the solutions are assumed to be in the limit of low concentration, excited close to their long-wave absorption band and at room temperature but may be either air-saturated or free of oxygen.</abstract>

      <abstract>We provide a conclusive demonstration of vibrational pumping under Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) conditions by performing anti-Stokes/Stokes ratio measurements over a large spatial area and low power density, down to 10 K with dried silver colloids, the dye rhodamine 6G, and 676 nm laser excitation. The method we propose allows for the measurement of the cross sections for different modes and also provides the determination of the asymmetry between the anti-Stokes and Stokes SERS cross sections for each mode.</abstract>

      <abstract>Anti-Stokes/Stokes asymmetries under surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) conditions are studied for a wide variety of SERS-active media and different analytes. Evidence is provided for the existence of underlying resonances that create these asymmetries. We show here that these resonances are associated with the electromagnetic coupling between the analyte (probe) and the metal. The work demonstrates the use of the anti-Stokes/Stokes ratio as a tool to understand the hierarchy of resonances in the SERS problem, which is essential for quantification purposes.</abstract>

      <abstract>We examined the fluorescence spectral properties of {C}y3- and {C}y5-labeled oligonucleotides at various distances from the surface of silver island films. {T}he distance to the surface was controlled by alternating layers of biotinylated bovine serum albumin ({BSA}) and avidin, followed by binding of a biotinylated oligonucleotide. {T}he maximum enhancement of fluorescence near a factor of 12 was observed for the first {BSA}-avidin layer, with the enhancement decreasing to 2-fold for six layers. {T}he minimum lifetimes were observed for the first {BSA}-avidin layer, and were about 25-fold shorter than on quartz slides without silver, with the lifetimes being about 2-fold shorter for six {BSA}-avidin layers. {T}hese results suggest that maximum fluorescence enhancements occur about 90 {\AA} from the silver surface, a distance readily obtained by one or two layers of proteins.</abstract>

      <abstract>We examined the fluorescent spectral properties of fluorescein-labeled DNA oligomers when directly bound to metallic silver particles via a terminal sulfhydryl group. We found a 12-fold increase in fluorescence intensity and 25-fold decrease in lifetime for a fluorescein residue positioned 23 nucleotides from the silver surface compared to labeled oligomers in free solution. Similar results were found for a 23-mer labeled with five fluorescein residues. The absence of long lifetime components in the intensity decays suggests that all labeled oligomers are bound to silver and affected similarly by the metallic surfaces. These results provide the basic knowledge needed to begin use of metal-enhanced fluorescence for the detection of target sequences in simple formats potentially without a washing separation step. The use of metal-enhanced fluorescence provides a generic approach to obtaining a hybridization-dependent increase in fluorescence with most, if not all, commonly used fluorophores.</abstract>

      <abstract>Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements were performed to elucidate the fluorescence quenching of oxazine, rhodamine, carbocyanine, and bora-diaza-indacene dyes by amino acids. Among the natural amino acids, tryptophan exhibits the most pronounced quenching efficiency. Especially, the red-absorbing dyes ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine derivative MR 121 are strongly quenched almost exclusively by tryptophan due to the formation of weak or nonfluorescent ground-state complexes with association constants, Kass., ranging from 96 to 206 M-1. Rhodamine, fluorescein, and bora-diaza-indacene derivatives that absorb at shorter wavelengths are also quenched substantially by tyrosine residues. The quenching of carbocyanine dyes, such as Cy5, and Alexa 647 by amino acids can be almost neglected. While quenching of ATTO 655, ATTO 680, and the oxazine derivative MR121 by tryptophan is dominated by static quenching, dynamic quenching is more efficient for the two bora-diaza-indacene dyes Bodipy-FL and Bodipy630/650. Labeling of the dyes to tryptophan, tryptophan-containing peptides, and proteins (streptavidin) demonstrates that knowledge of these fluorescence quenching processes is crucial for the development of fluorescence-based diagnostic assays. Changes in the fluorescence quantum yield of dye-labeled peptides and proteins might be used advantageously for the quantification of proteases and specific binding partners.</abstract>

      <abstract>With respect to the origin of single-molecule sensitivity in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), elastic scattering and emission spectra were studied for Ag particles adsorbed with dye or adenine molecules. The scattering peak observed at 600-650 nm was extinguished during the inactivation process of the enormous SERS signal, whereas localized surface plasmon (LSP) peaks located at 520 and 730 nm did not change significantly. It was found using a numerical simulation that the additional scattering peak arises from increased electromagnetic coupling between the LSP of adjacent Ag particles through dye molecules located at their junction. In addition, two distinct emission peaks were observed at 550-600 and 600-750 nm only for hot Ag particles with adsorbates. Based on the observations for different surface coverages and on different dye species, these bands were attributed to enhanced radiative decay of LSP and fluorescence of molecules, respectively. Interestingly, adenine molecules on the Ag nanoparticles show similar fluorescence peaks at 600-650 nm, suggesting a charge-transfer state upon adsorption.</abstract>

      <abstract>Colloidal gold nanocrystals have been used to develop a new class of nanobiosensors that is able to recognize and detect specific DNA sequences and single-base mutations in a homogeneous format. At the core of this biosensor is a 2.5-nm gold nanoparticle that functions as both a nano-scaffold and a nano-quencher (efficient energy acceptor). Attached to this core are oligonucleotide molecules labeled with a thiol group at one end and a fluorophore at the other. This hybrid bio/inorganic construct is found to spontaneously assemble into a constrained arch-like conformation on the particle surface. Binding of target molecules results in a conformational change, which restores the fluorescence of the quenched fluorophore. Unlike conventional molecular beacons with a stem-and-loop structure, the nanoparticle probes do not require a stem, and their background fluorescence increases little with temperature. In comparison with the organic quencher Dabcyl (4,4'-dimethylaminophenyl azo benzoic acid), metal nanoparticles have unique structural and optical properties for new applications in biosensing and molecular engineering.</abstract>

      <abstract>Controlled formation of complex nanostructures is one of the main goals of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Stable Protein 1 (SP1) is a boiling-stable ring protein complex, 11 nm in diameter, which self-assembles from 12 identical monomers. SP1 can be utilized to form large ordered arrays; it can be easily modified by genetic engineering to produce various mutants; it is also capable of binding gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and thus forming protein-GNP chains made of alternating SP1s and GNPs. We report the formation and the protocols leading to the formation of those nanostructures and their characterization by transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and electrostatic force microscopy. Further control over the GNP interdistances within the protein-GNP chains may lead to the formation of nanowires and structures that may be useful for nanoelectronics.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present a theoretical study of the modifications of the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of an optical emitter in close proximity to a noble-metal nanosphere, based on exact electrodynamical theory. We show that the optimal nanosphere diameter for luminescence quantum efficiency enhancement associated with resonant coupling to plasmon modes is in the range of 30-110 nm, depending on the material properties. The optimal diameter is found to be a trade-off between (1) emitter-plasmon coupling, which is most effective for small spheres, and (2) the outcoupling of plasmons into radiation, which is most efficient for large spheres. In addition, we show that the well-known Gersten and Nitzan model does not describe the existence of a finite optimal diameter unless the model is extended with the correction factor for radiation damping. With this correction and a correction for dynamic depolarization, the mathematically simpler Gersten and Nitzan model provides a reasonably accurate approximation of the decay rate modifications associated with coupling to the dipole plasmon mode. We anticipate that the Gersten and Nitzan model in the form that we validate in this paper for spheres will allow the analytical investigation of the influence of shape anisotropy on plasmon-enhanced luminescence.</abstract>

      <abstract>An apparatus is described that can determine electrophoretic mobilities of polar and nonpolar colloidal dispersions down to 1 x 10-12 m2 s-1 V-1, with typical resolutions of 0.5 to 5%, depending on the nature of the dispersion being studied. The diffusion coefficient and settling/convection velocity of the sample may be determined simultaneously with the electrophoretic mobility in real time. The technique, phase analysis light scattering (PALS), is based upon classical laser-Doppler electrophoresis, but employs signal processing of the time domain phase information within the scattered light signal, rather than analysis of its frequency spectrum. This allows much smaller electric field strengths to be employed, thereby alleviating the usual heating problems associated with electrophoretic studies of nonpolar dispersions. PALS measurements of typical aqueous latex dispersions with large mobilities and some nonpolar dispersions with very small mobilities are presented to illustrate the versatility of this technique.</abstract>

      <abstract>Colloidal particles of metals and semiconductors have potentially useful optical, optoelectronic and material properties1?4 that derive from their small (nanoscopic) size. These properties might lead to applications including chemical sensors, spectro-scopic enhancers, quantum dot and nanostructure fabrication, and microimaging methods2?4. A great deal of control can now be exercised over the chemical composition, size and polydis-persity1,2 of colloidal particles, and many methods have been developed for assembling them into useful aggregates and materials. Here we describe a method for assembling colloidal gold nanoparticles rationally and reversibly into macroscopic aggregates. The method involves attaching to the surfaces of two batches of 13-nm gold particles non-complementary DNA oligo-nucleotides capped with thiol groups, which bind to gold. When we add to the solution an oligonucleotide duplex with 'sticky ends' that are complementary to the two grafted sequences, the nanoparticles self-assemble into aggregates. This assembly process can be reversed by thermal denaturation. This strategy should now make it possible to tailor the optical, electronic and structural properties of the colloidal aggregates by using the specificity of DNA interactions to direct the interactions between particles of different size and composition.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present a systematic study of the effect of size and shape on the spectral response of individual silver nanoparticles. An experimental method has been developed that begins with the detection and characterization of isolated nanoparticles in the optical far field. The plasmon resonance optical spectrum of many individual nanoparticles are then correlated to their size and shape using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We find that specific geometrical shapes give distinct spectral responses. In addition, inducing subtle changes in the particles' morphology by heating causes a shift in the individual particle spectrum and provides a simple means of tuning the spectral response to a desired optical wavelength. Improved colloidal preparation methods could potentially lead to homogeneous populations of identical particle shapes and colors. These multicolor colloids could be used as biological labels, surface enhanced Raman scattering substrates, or near field optical microscopy sources covering the full range of wavelengths in the visible spectrum.</abstract>

      <abstract>A general overview of the optoelectronic properties of pi-conjugated polymers is presented. Two types of polymer are discerned: interchangeable structures of the same energy (degenerate), such as polyacetylene; and non-degenerate polymers, such as poly(para-phenylene). The band structures of degenerate and non-degenerate polymers are related to their conductivities in doped and non-doped states. In both cases, disorder and impurities play an important role in conductivity. Polarons, bipolarons and excitons are detailed with respect to doping and charge transfers. Given the fibrillic nature of these materials, the variable range hopping (VRH) law for semiconducting polymers is modified to account for metallic behaviours. Optoelectronic properties - electroluminescence and photovoltaic activity - are explained in terms of HOMO and LUMO bands, polaron-exciton and charge movement over one or more molecules. The properties of H- or J-type aggregates and their effects on transitions are related to target applications. Device structures of polymer light-emitting diodes are explicitly linked to optimising polaron recombinations and overall quantum efficiencies. The particularly promising use of ?-conjugated polymers in photovoltaic devices is discussed.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present a description of how the collective electronic excitation in a small metal particle leads to a large field enhancement in the surface region which induces electronic transitions resulting eventually in the desorption of atoms. Our results for the frequency and radial dependence of the desorption yield are in good agreement with recent experimental findings for sodium particles, and make it possible to extract information about the effective number of desorption sites for a small particle.</abstract>

      <abstract>Highly accurate computations of surface plasmons in metallic nanostructures with various geometries are presented. Calculations for cylinders with irregular cross section, coupled structures, and periodic gratings are shown. These systems exhibit a resonant behavior with complex field distribution and strong field enhancement, and therefore their computation requires a very accurate numerical method. It is shown that the multiple multipole (MMP) method, together with an automatic multipole setting (AMS) procedure, is well suited for these computations. An AMS technique for the two-dimensional MMP method is presented. It relies on the global topology of each domain boundary to generate a distribution of numerically independent multipole expansions. This technique greatly facilitates the MMP modeling.</abstract>

      <abstract>Fast and numerically stable transfer-matrix solution is presented for the classical electromagnetics problem of a dipole radiating inside and outside a stratified sphere consisting of concentric spherical shells. There is no limitation on the dipole position, the number of the concentric shells, the shell medium, or on the sphere radius. Electromagnetic fields are determined anywhere in the space, the time-averaged angular distribution of the radiated power, the total radiated power, Ohmic losses due to an absorbing shell, and Green?s function are calculated. An absorbing, optically active, and ultrathin (less, approximate10 nm) metallic shell (core), characterized by a nonlocal dielectric function, are all allowed. The classical results are then applied to inelastic light scattering (fluorescence and Raman), the radiative and nonradiative normalized decay rates, and frequency shift. Using correspondence principle, the radiative decay rate is calculated from the Poynting vector, whereas the nonradiative decay rate is calculated from the Ohmic losses inside a sphere absorptive shell. Numerical stability of our method and limitations of classical description of decay rates are addressed. The importance of grouping various radiative and nonradiative decay mechanisms into local and nonlocal decay rates is emphasized. Further possible extensions of the theory presented here to the case of an arbitrary multilayered (axially symmetric) particle and to the classical problem of a radiating quadrupole in the presence of a multilayered particle are briefly outlined. Various applications for chemical speciation, LIDAR, fluorescent microscopy, engineering of decay rates, identification of biological particles, and monitoring specific cell functions are envisaged.

      <abstract>Frequency shifts, radiative decay rates, the Ohmic loss contribution to the nonradiative decay rates, fluorescence yield, and photobleaching of a two-level atom radiating anywhere inside or outside a complex spherical nanoshell, i.e., a stratified sphere consisting of alternating silica and gold concentric spherical shells, are studied. The changes in the spectroscopic properties of an atom interacting with complex nanoshells are significantly enhanced, often more than two orders of magnitude, compared to the same atom interacting with a homogeneous dielectric sphere. The detected fluorescence intensity can be enhanced by 5 or more orders of magnitude. The changes strongly depend on the nanoshell parameters and the atom position. When an atom approaches a metal shell, decay rates are strongly enhanced yet fluorescence yield exhibits a well-known quenching. Rather contra-intuitively, the Ohmic loss contribution to the nonradiative decay rates for an atomic dipole within the silica core of larger nanoshells may be decreasing when the silica core-inner gold shell interface is approached. The quasi-static result that the radial frequency shift in a close proximity of a spherical shell interface is approximately twice as large as the tangential frequency shift appears to apply also for complex nanoshells. Significantly modified spectroscopic properties (see computer program available at http://www.wave-scattering.com) can be observed in a broad band comprising all (nonresonant) optical and near-infrared wavelengths.</abstract>

      <abstract>The electromagnetic theory of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), despite its simplicity, can account for all major SERS observations, including: the need for a nanostructured material as the SERS-active system; the observation that some metals form good SERS-active systems while others do not; the observation that strongly interacting metal nanoparticles result in very much more effective SERS-active systems; the observed polarization sensitivity shown by nanoparticle aggregates; and the optical behavior of nanostructured metals in the absence of a molecular adsorbate. By extending the ideas inherent in the electromagnetic model one can also understand the seminal features reported for single-molecule SERS, including the puzzling observation that only a few silver particles in an ensemble are hot (they are appropriately structured nanoparticle clusters) and that for a hot particle, once one is able to observe SERS, adding more adsorbate does not significantly alter the intensity (once the electromagnetic hot spot is occupied, adding adsorbate to other sites on the nanoparticle cluster will not add greatly to the observed intensity). However, the electromagnetic model does not account for all that is learned through SERS. Molecular resonances, charge-transfer transitions and other processes such as ballistic electrons transiently probing the region where the molecule resides and then modulating electronic processes of the metal as a result certainly contribute to the rich information SERS reports; and by virtue of the fact that these contributions will vary from molecule to molecule, they will constitute the most interesting aspects reported by SERS. But, the overall reason why SERS produces such inordinate enhancements is largely an electromagnetic property of nanostructures.</abstract>

      <abstract>In 1978 it was discovered, largely through the work of Fleischmann, Van Duyne, Creighton, and their coworkers that molecules adsorbed on specially prepared silver surfaces produce a Raman spectrum that is at times a millionfold more intense than expected. This effect was dubbed surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Since then the effect has been demonstrated with many molecules and with a number of metals, including Cu, Ag, Au, Li, Na, K, In, Pt, and Rh. In addition, related phenomena such as surface-enhanced second-harmonic generation, four-wave mixing, absorption, and fluorescence have been observed. Although not all fine points of the enhancement mechanism have been clarified, the majority view is that the largest contributor to the intensity amplification results from the electric field enhancement that occurs in the vicinity of small, interacting metal particles that are illuminated with light resonant or near resonant with the localized surface-plasmon frequency of the metal structure. Small in this context is gauged in relation to the wavelength of light. The special preparations required to produce the effect, which include among other techniques electrochemical oxidation-reduction cycling, deposition of metal on very cold substrates, and the generation of metal-island films and colloids, is now understood to be necessary as a means of producing surfaces with appropriate electromagnetic resonances that may couple to electromagnetic fields either by generating rough films (as in the case of the former two examples) or by placing small metal particles in close proximity to one another (as in the case of the latter two). For molecules chemisorbed on SERS-active surface there exists a "chemical enhancement" in addition to the electromagnetic effect. Although difficult to measure accurately, the magnitude of this effect rarely exceeds a factor of 10 and is best thought to arise from the modification of the Raman polarizability tensor of the adsorbate resulting from the formation of a complex between the adsorbate and the metal. Rather than an enhancement mechanism, the chemical effect is more logically to be regarded as a change in the nature and identity of the adsorbate.</abstract>

      <abstract>Greatly enhanced Raman scattering from monolayers of pyridine adsorbed on silver has been reported by several authors. I propose that the anomalous intensity arises from preresonant or resonant excitations of conduction electron resonances in adsorbate covered metal bumps on the surface. The bumps form a two-dimensional colliodlike layer which displays a collective resonance at a frequency which depends on the bump density. The model can account for the disparate excitation functions reported by two groups in terms of varying degrees of roughness. The apparent lack of enhancement with metals other than Group Ib is also explained.</abstract>

      <abstract>The use of optical measurements to monitor electrochemical changes on the surface of nanosized metal particles is discussed within the Drude model. The absorption spectrum of a metal sol in water is shown to be strongly affected by cathodic or anodic polarization, chemisorption, metal adatom deposition, and alloying. Anion adsorption leads to strong damping of the free electron absorption. Cathodic polarization leads to anion desorption. Underpotential deposition (upd) of electropositive metal layers results in dramatic blue-shifts of the surface plasmon band of the substrate. The deposition of just 0.1 monolayer can be readily detected by eye. In some cases alloying occurs spontaneously during upd. Alloy formation can be ascertained from the optical absorption spectrum in the case of gold deposition onto silver sols. The underpotential deposition of silver adatoms onto palladium leads to the formation of a homogeneous silver shell, but the mean free path is less than predicted, due to lattice strain in the shell.</abstract>

      <abstract>The use of nanometre thick silica shells as a means to stabilize metal clusters and semiconductor particles is discussed, and its potential advantages over conventional organic capping agents are presented. Shell deposition depends on control of the double layer potential, and requires priming of the core particle surface. Chemical reactions are possible within the core, via diffusion of reactants through the shell layer. Quantum dots can be stabilized against photochemical degradation through silica deposition, whilst retaining strong fluorescence quantum yields and their size dependent optical properties. Ordered 3D and 2D arrays of a macroscopic size with uniform particle spacing can be created. Thin colloid films can also be created with well-defined interparticle spacing, allowing controlled coupling of exciton and surface plasmon modes to be investigated. A number of future core-shell nanocomposite structures are postulated, including quantum bubbles and single electron capacitors based on AuSiO2</abstract>

      <abstract>We demonstrate a strong, 5-fold enhancement of the radiative decay rate from highly efficient fluorescent dye molecules around resonant optical nanoantennas. The plasmonic modes of individual gold dimer antennas are tuned by the particle length and the antenna gap, providing control over both the spectral resonance position and the near-field mode profile of the nanoantenna. Resonant enhancement of the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of a fluorescent dye is observed, resulting in an increase of the internal quantum efficiency from 40% up to 53% for single antennas, and up to 59% for antenna clusters. This improvement of the already high quantum efficiency of the dye molecules is in agreement with electrodynamic model calculations that predict a maximum attainable efficiency around 80% due to nonradiative losses in the metal.</abstract>

      <abstract>The magnitudes, time scales, and underlying mechanisms responsible for broadening the electronic spectra of molecules in liquid solutions and glasses are reviewed. The emphasis is on experimental results from hole-burning, single-molecule, photon echo, and resonance Raman and fluorescence studies. The influence of the time scale of the measurement in distinguishing between homogeneous broadening (electronic dephasing) and inhomogeneous broadening is discussed, and the role of coupling of solvent phonons to the solute's electronic transition is stressed.</abstract>

      <abstract>A concept to electrically control the scattering of light is introduced. The idea is to embed noble metal nanoparticles in an electro-optical material such as a liquid crystal in order to induce a spectral shift of the particle plasmon resonance by applying an electric field. Light scattering experiments on single gold nanoparticles show that spherically shaped nanoparticles become optically spheroidal when covered by an anisotropic liquid crystal. The two particle plasmon resonances of the optically spheroidal gold nanoparticles can be spectrally shifted by up to 50 meV when electric fields of more than 10 kV/cm are applied.</abstract>

The formation of particle aggregates was observed upon mixing the particle solution with the complex solution, in which the complexes behaved like linker molecules. Luminescent intensity of the complexes was enhanced in the presence of silver nanoparticles, but at only a limited particle concentration region. The observed particle concentration dependences of the luminescent intensity were regarded as the result of a delicate balance between an enhancing and a quenching effect of the silver nanoparticles. In addition to the change in intensity, silver nanoparticles also affected the asymmetric ratio (or monochromaticity) of the europium luminescence. These changes in the luminescent properties of the complex were discussed in terms of the effects of particle aggregates and consequent modifications of the local electromagnetic field, refractive index, and the ligand field around europium ion.</abstract>

      <abstract>We studied fluorescence intensity, polarization and lifetime of some commonly used fluorophores conjugated to oligodeoxyribonucleotides with different primary and secondary structures. We found that fluorescence intensity can increase or decrease upon hybridization of the labeled strand to its complement depending on the sequence and position of the fluorophore. Up to 10-fold quenching of the fluorescence upon hybridization was observed when the dye moiety was attached close to the 3' end and the 3'-terminal base was either dG or dC. No quenching upon hybridization was observed when the dye was positioned within the same sequence context but close to the 5' end. The presence of a dG overhang quenches the fluorescence less efficiently than a blunt end dG-dC or dC-dG base pair. When located internally in the double strand, the dG-dC base pair does not affect the fluorescence of the nearby dye. Guanosine in a single-stranded oligonucleotide quenches the fluorescence of nearby dye by &lt;2-fold. Upon duplex formation, this quenching is eliminated and the fluorescence increases. This increase can only be detected when the fluorophore is located at least 6 nt from the terminal dG-dC base pair. The change of fluorescence polarization upon duplex formation inversely correlates with the change of intensity. Fluorescein conjugated to a single-stranded oligonucleotide or a duplex undergoes a bi-exponential decay with 4 and 1 ns lifetimes.</abstract>

      <abstract>Small gold clusters ( 1 nm) protected by molecules of a tripeptide, glutathione (GSH), were prepared by reductive decomposition of Au(I)-SG polymers at a low temperature and separated into a number of fractions by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Chemical compositions of the fractionated clusters determined previously by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (Negishi, Y. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 6518) were reassessed by taking advantage of freshly prepared samples, higher mass resolution, and more accurate mass calibration; the nine smallest components are reassigned to Au10(SG)10, Au15(SG)13, Au18(SG)14, Au22(SG)16, Au22(SG)17, Au25(SG)18, Au29(SG)20, Au33(SG)22, and Au39(SG)24. These assignments were further confirmed by measuring the mass spectra of the isolated Au:S(h-G) clusters, where h-GSH is a homoglutathione. It is proposed that a series of the isolated Au:SG clusters corresponds to kinetically trapped intermediates of the growing Au cores. The relative abundance of the isolated clusters was correlated well with the thermodynamic stabilities against unimolecular decomposition. The electronic structures of the isolated Au:SG clusters were probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and optical spectroscopy. The Au(4f) XPS spectra illustrate substantial electron donation from the gold cores to the GS ligands in the Au:SG clusters. The optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra indicate that the electronic structures of the Au:SG clusters are well quantized; embryos of the sp band of the bulk gold evolve remarkably depending on the number of the gold atoms and GS ligands. The comparison of these spectral data with those of sodium Au(I) thiomalate and 1.8 nm Au:SG nanocrystals (NCs) reveals that the subnanometer-sized Au clusters thiolated constitute a distinct class of binary system which lies between the Au(I)-thiolate complexes and thiolate-protected Au NCs.</abstract>

      <abstract>Nearly monodispersed Au12 clusters protected by monolayers of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) exhibited luminescence at 630 nm with a quantum yield of 1 × 10?6 upon the photoexcitation at 395 nm to the lowest electronic excited state. The visible PL is assigned to phosphorescence originating from a triplet-like excited state based on the large Stokes shift (1.2 eV). The PL quantum yield was enhanced up to ?0.9%, greater by eight orders of magnitude than that of bulk gold, by thickening the protecting layer and freezing a solvent at 77 K. The emission peak energy is discussed within the context of core-size dependent electronic structures by comparison with those of thiolate-protected gold clusters reported in the literature.</abstract>

      <abstract>We consider the resonant optical force acting on a pair of transparent microspheres by the excitation of morphology-dependent resonance (MDR). The bonding and antibonding modes of the MDR correspond to strong attraction and repulsion, respectively. The dependence of the force on separation and the role of absorption are discussed. At resonance, the force can be enhanced by orders of magnitude such that it will dominate other relevant forces. We found that a stable binding configuration can be induced by the resonant optical force.</abstract>

      <abstract>Optical detection and spectroscopy of single molecules and single nanoparticles have been achieved at room temperature with the use of surface-enhanced Raman scattering. Individual silver colloidal nanoparticles were screened from a large heterogeneous population for special size-dependent properties and were then used to amplify the spectroscopic signatures of adsorbed molecules. For single rhodamine 6G molecules adsorbed on the selected nanoparticles, the intrinsic Raman enhancement factors were on the order of 1014 to 1015, much larger than the ensemble-averaged values derived from conventional measurements. This enormous enhancement leads to vibrational Raman signals that are more intense and more stable than single-molecule fluorescence.</abstract>

      <abstract>The electronic structure of a monolayer-protected gold cluster, [Au13(SCH3)8]3+, has been investigated by performing density functional calculations. The cluster has a characteristic structure with Oh molecular symmetry, and eight (111) facets of a centered cuboctahedral Au13 core cluster are fully passivated by eight methanethiolates. The bond distance between two neighboring gold atoms (3.673 {\AA}) is much larger than that of the bare Au13 cluster (2.929 {\AA}), whereas the Au-S bond distance is 2.403 {\AA}. This atomic rearrangement means that the methanethiolates stabilize the enlarged bare Au13 cluster by bonding to the (111) hollow sites of the bare cluster. The absorption spectrum of the [Au13(SCH3)8]3+ cluster is simulated within time-dependent density functional theory. The spectrum shows clear absorption peaks and each peak is assigned to specific excitation processes.</abstract>

      <abstract>We have found that {R}6{G} laser dye in a concentration of 0.1 g l$^{\&amp;minus;1}$ mixed with a solution of aggregated silver nanoparticles exhibits a new emission band with a maximum at 612 nm. {T}his band does not exist in pure dye of comparable concentration or in a mixture of dye with a solution of single silver nanoparticles. {A} qualitatively similar red-shifted emission band is observed in pure {R}6{G} dye at very high concentration (3.8 or 16.7 g l$^{\&amp;minus;1}$). {I}n both cases, no changes occur to the shapes of the absorption spectra of the dye. {W}e explain the observed spectral changes in terms of {J}-aggregates of {R}6{G} molecules whose formation is probable in the presence of {A}g aggregates with a complicated surface structure and is much less likely in the case of adsorption of dye molecules on single {A}g nanoparticles. {A}lternatively, many features observed in the experiment can be explained by an enhancement of the rates of spontaneous radiative transitions in the proximity of metallic particles, which is due to a modification of the local density of electromagnetic modes in the vicinity of metal surfaces at energies resonant with surface plasmon resonances.</abstract>

      <abstract>Complementary, single-strands of DNA (ssDNA), one bound to a gold electrode and the other to a gold nanoparticle were hybridized on the surface to form a self-assembled, dsDNA bridge between the two gold contacts. The adsorption of a ssDNA monolayer at each gold interface eliminates non-specific interactions of the dsDNA with the surface, allowing bridge formation only upon hybridization. The technique used, in addition to providing a good electrical contact, offers topographical contrast between the gold nanoparticles and the non-hybridized surface and enables accurate location of the bridge for the electrical measurements. Reproducible AFM conductivity measurements have been performed and significant qualitative differences were detected between conductivity in single- and double-strand DNA. The ssDNA was found to be insulating over a 4 eV range between ±2 V under the studied conditions, while the dsDNA, bound to the gold nanoparticle, behaves like a wide band gap semiconductor and passes significant current outside of a 3 eV gap.</abstract>

      <abstract>The increased sensitivity and the advantage of new lopw-cost optical sources and detectros in the red region creates a great demand for new efficient fluorescence labels in this wavelength region. Here some problems arise due to the fact that with increasing absorption wavelength the fluorescence quantum yield drastically decreases, especially in aqueous media. Additionally, organic dyes may aggregate and show non-specific agginities to biological materials. We investigate the interactions of recently developed fluorescent dyes and two commercially available fluorescent dyes with the DNA base guanosine. The results obtained in intermolecular quenching experiments reveal various fluorescence quenching effects. Due to the increasing hydrophobicity of fluorescent dyes with increasing molecular size the aggregation tendency with biological materials also increases. Therefore ground and excited state interactions increase thus promoting the observed fluorescence quenching.</abstract>

      <abstract>Abstract: We apply the recently developed plasmon hybridization method to nanoparticle dimers, providing a simple and intuitive description of how the energy and excitation cross sections of dimer plasmons depend on nanoparticle separation. We show that the dimer plasmons can be viewed as bonding and antibonding combinations, i.e., hybridization of the individual nanoparticle plasmons. The calculated plasmon energies are compared with results from FDTD simulations.</abstract>

      <abstract>Atomic force microscopy and single-molecule force spectroscopy were combined to image and manipulate purple membrane patches from Halobacterium salinarum. Individual bacteriorhodopsin molecules were first localized and then extracted from the membrane; the remaining vacancies were imaged again. Anchoring forces between 100 and 200 piconewtons for the different helices were found. Upon extraction, the helices were found to unfold. The force spectra revealed the individuality of the unfolding pathways. Helices G and F as well as helices E and D always unfolded pairwise, whereas helices B and C occasionally unfolded one after the other. Experiments with cleaved loops revealed the origin of the individuality: stabilization of helix B by neighboring helices.</abstract>

      <abstract>An inhibition assay method was developed based on the modulation in the FRET efficiency between quantum dots (QDs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in the presence of the molecules which inhibit the interactions between QD- and AuNP-conjugated biomolecules. For the functionalization, AuNPs were first stabilized by chemisorption of n-alkanethiols and then capped with the first generation polyamidoamine (G1 PAMAM) dendrimers. By employing a streptavidin-biotin couple as a model system, avidin was quantitatively analyzed as an inhibitor by sensing the change in photoluminescence (PL) quenching of SA-QDs by biotin-AuNPs. The detection limit for avidin was about 10 nM. It is anticipated that the PL quenching-based sensing system can be used for the quantitative analysis and high throughput screening of molecules which inhibit the specific biomolecular interactions.</abstract>

      <abstract>The distance- and polarization-dependent near-field enhancement of two coupling metal nanoparticles (MNPs) is analyzed by means of the novel scanning particle enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SPRM) technique. In contrast to single MNP Raman experiments, the near-field coupling between two dissimilar MNPs as followed here leads to a Raman hot spot yielding an extra enhancement factor of 17.6 and 20, as proven here both in experiment and in theory. Three-dimensional electric field calculations for our two-particle arrangements were performed using the semianalytical multiple-multipole method. An excellent agreement is found to our experiments, in which we inspect the interaction between a "scanning" 30 nm gold MNP (Au30) and a "fixed" 80 nm Au MNP (Au80). The Au80 MNP is attached to the apex of an optical fiber manipulator and exposed to the Gaussian focus of a high NA = 1.45 objective at = 532 nm. A monolayer of 1-octanethiol molecules covering the Au80 MNP serves as the electric field prober when scanning the Au30 MNP through the optical focus. This constellation allows recording the Raman signatures from a very low number of well-confined molecules. Moreover, also the spectral and spatial dependence could be explored with a superb sensitivity and very low integration time.</abstract>

      <abstract>Immobilized gold colloid particles coated with a C-18 alkylsilane layer have been characterized as a substrate for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) studies of adsorption onto hydrophobic surfaces. Atomic force microscopy images, optical extinction spectra, and SERS measurements are reported as a function of accumulation of gold colloid on glass. As the metal particles become increasingly aggregated on the surface, the SERS enhancement increases until the plasmon resonance shifts to wavelengths longer than the excitation laser. The gold colloid substrates are stable and exhibit reproducible SERS enhancement. When octadecyltrimethoxysilane is self-assembled over the gold, the metal surface is protected from exposure to solution-phase species, as evidenced by the inhibition of chemisorption of a disulfide reagent to the overcoated gold surface. The results show that interactions with gold can be blocked by a silane layer so as not to significantly influence physisorption of molecules at the C-18/solution interface. The SERS enhancement from these C-18-overcoated gold substrates is reproducible for different films prepared from the same colloidal suspension; the substrates are also stable with time and upon exposure to laser irradiation.</abstract>

      <abstract>On the basis of different types of experiments, the authors develop implicitly the model of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of adsorbates on metal surfaces. The long-range enhancement by resonances of the macroscopic laser and Stokes field is separated quantitatively from the metal electron-mediated resonance Raman effect. The latter mechanism proceeds by increased electron-photon coupling at an atomically rough surface and by temporary charge transfer to orbitals of the adsorbates. This model can account for the chemical specificity and vibrational selectivity of SERS and (partly) for the SERS specificity of the various metals.</abstract>

      <abstract>Abstract: The optical properties of metallic nanoshell dimers are investigated using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. We discuss issues of numerical convergence specific for the dimer system. We present results for both homodimers and heterodimers. The results show that retardation effects must be taken into account for an accurate description of realistic size nanoparticle dimers. The optical properties of the nanoshell dimer are found to be strongly polarization dependent. Maximal coupling between the nanoshells in a dimer occurs when the electric field of the incident pulse is aligned parallel to the dimer axis. The wavelengths of the peaks in the extinction cross section of the dimer are shown to vary by more than 100 nm, depending on the incident electric field polarization. The calculations show that electric field enhancements in the dimer junctions depend strongly on dimer separation. The maximum field enhancements occur in the dimer junction and at the expense of a reduced electric field enhancement in other regions of space. We investigate the usefulness of nanoshell dimers substrates for SERS by integrating the fourth power of the electric field enhancements around the surfaces of the nanoparticles as a function of dimer separation and wavelength. The SERS efficiency is shown to depend strongly on dimer separation but much weaker than the fourth power of the maximum electric field enhancement at a particular point. The SERS efficiency is also found to depend strongly on the wavelength of the incident light. Maximum SERS efficiency occurs for resonant excitation of the dimer plasmons.</abstract>

      <abstract>The optical properties of metallodielectric nanostructures, variations of a core-shell geometry, are investigated using the finite difference time domain method. This method provides a convenient, systematic, and general approach for calculating the optical response of a nanostructure of arbitrary symmetry and geometry to an incident light wave. Properties such as the optical absorption and scattering cross sections as well as the local electromagnetic fields and induced charge densities at the surfaces of the nanostructures can be obtained by this method. Issues of convergence with grid size and other simulation parameters are discussed in detail. The method is applied to uniform single nanoshells, nanoshells with surface defects, and nanoshells with shape distortions from a spherical geometry. The results show that, while defects can significantly affect local surface field enhancements, far field properties such as optical absorption and scattering spectra can be remarkably insensitive to defects and distortions.</abstract>

      <abstract>Alexa 350, Alexa 430, Alexa 488, Alexa 532, Alexa 546, Alexa 568, and Alexa 594 dyes are a new series of fluorescent dyes with emission/excitation spectra similar to those of AMCA, Lucifer Yellow, fluorescein, rhodamine 6G, tetramethylrhodamine or Cy3, lissamine rhodamine B, and Texas Red, respectively (the numbers in the Alexa names indicate the approximate excitation wavelength maximum in nm). All Alexa dyes and their conjugates are more fluorescent and more photostable than their commonly used spectral analogues listed above. In addition, Alexa dyes are insensitive to pH in the 4-10 range. We evaluated Alexa dyes compared with conventional dyes in applications using various conjugates, including those of goat anti-mouse IgG (GAM), streptavidin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and concanavalin A (ConA). Conjugates of Alexa 546 are at least twofold more fluo-rescent than Cy3 conjugates. Proteins labeled with the Alexa 568 or Alexa 594 dyes are several-fold brighter than the same proteins labeled with lissamine rhodamine B or Texas Red dyes, respectively. Alexa dye derivatives of phalloidin stain F-actin with high specificity. Hydrazide forms of the Alexa dyes are very bright, formaldehyde-fixable polar tracers. Conjugates of the Alexa 430 (ex 430 nm/em 520 nm) and Alexa 532 (ex 530 nm/em 548 nm) fluorochromes are spectrally unique fluorescent probes, with relatively high quantum yields in their excitation and emission wavelength ranges.</abstract>

      <abstract>Due to their interesting properties, research on colloidal nanocrystals has moved in the last few years from fundamental research to first applications in materials science and life sciences. In this review some recent biological applications of colloidal nanocrystals are discussed, without going into biological or chemical details. First, the properties of colloidal nanocrystals and how they can be synthesized are described. Second, the conjugation of nanocrystals with biological molecules is discussed. And third, three different biological applications are introduced: (i) the arrangement of nanocrystal-oligonucleotide conjugates using molecular scaffolds such as single-stranded DNA, (ii) the use of nanocrystal-protein conjugates as fluorescent probes for cellular imaging, and (iii) a motility assay based on the uptake of nanocrystals by living cells.</abstract>

      <abstract>Water-soluble, highly fluorescent, silanized semiconductor nanocrystals with different surface charges were synthesized. To covalently attach the nanocrystals to biological macromolecules with a variety of mild coupling chemistries, the outermost siloxane shells were derivatized with thiol, amino, or carboxyl functional groups. Single- or double-stranded DNA was coupled to the nanocrystal surfaces by using commercially available bifunctional cross-linker. Conjugation had little effect on the optical properties of the nanocrystals, and the resulting conjugates were more stable than previously reported systems. By using the strategies developed in this study, most biomolecules can be covalently coupled to semiconductor nanocrystals. These nanocrystal-DNA conjugates promise to be a versatile tool for fluorescence imaging and probing of biological systems.</abstract>

      <abstract>The conformation of thiol-linked oligonucleotides on the surface of Au nanoparticles was controlled by treatment with 6-mercapto-1-hexanol (MCH). MCH displaces noncovalent base adsorption to the surface, changing the oligo conformation on the Au surface. By controlling MCH concentration and reaction time, a change in effective size (Deff) of the Au-DNA conjugates and improved hybridization ability was observed, suggesting a reduced nonspecific adsorption of the oligo to the Au.</abstract>

      <abstract>Membrane potential around single molecules has been measured by using the nonlinear optical phenomenon of second harmonic generation. This advance results from the interaction between a highly dipolar molecule with a selectively directed highly polarizable 1-nm gold particle. With this approach, a second harmonic signal, which is enhanced by the nanoparticle, is detected from a volume of nanometric dimensions. This present work clearly shows that functional cellular imaging around single molecules is possible by selectively directing an antibody with a 1-nm gold label to a specific membrane protein. The results of this work open the way for three-dimensional, high resolution functional imaging of membrane electrophysiology in cells and cellular networks.</abstract>

      <abstract>The surface plasmon damping induced by high excitation of the electron gas is studied in femtosecond pump-and-probe experiments on gold colloids embedded in a sol-gel matrix. Optical excitation of single-particle interband transitions leads to a pronounced broadening of the surface plasmon line. A similar behavior is observed for resonant excitation of the surface plasmon. This broadening is the dominant optical nonlinearity of the system, and reflects the excitation-induced damping of the surface plasmon resonance. The time evolution of the damping rate follows that of the electronic scattering rate.</abstract>

      <abstract>The pore size of agarose gel in water at different concentrations was directly measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The experiment was specially designed to work under aqueous conditions and allows direct observation of the ?unperturbed? gel without invasive treatment. The pore size a as a function of gel concentration C shows a power law dependence a ? C-?, where ? lies between the prediction of the Ogston model for a random array of straight chains, 0.5, and the value predicted by De Gennes for a network of flexible chains, 0.75. We confirm that gels present a wide pore size distribution and show that it narrows as the concentration increases.</abstract>

      <abstract>We have investigated the impact of steric effects on the hybridization and enzymatic extension of oligonucleotides bound to 12-nm colloidal Au particles. In these experiments, a nanoparticle-bound 12-mer sequence is hybridized either to its solution phase 12-mer complement or to an 88-mer template sequence. The particle-bound oligonucleotide serves as a primer for enzymatic extension reactions, in which covalent incorporation of nucleotides to form the complement of the template is achieved by the action of DNA polymerase. Primers were attached via-C6H12SH, -C12H24SH, and -TTACAATC6H12SH linkers attached at the 5' end. Primer coverage on the nanoparticles was varied by dilution with 5'HSC6H12AAA AAA3'. Hybridization efficiencies were determined as a function of linker length, primer coverage, complement length (12-mer vs 88-mer), and primer:complement concentration ratio. In all cases, hybridization for the 88-mer was less efficient than for the 12-mer. Low primer surface coverages, greater particle-primer separation, and higher primer:complement ratios led to optimal hybridization. Hybridization efficiencies as high as 98% and 75% were observed for the 12-mer and 88-mer, respectively. Enzymatic extension of particle-bound primers was observed under all conditions tested; however, the efficiency of the reaction was strongly affected by linker length and primer coverage. Extension of primers attached by the longest linker was as efficient as the solution-phase reaction.</abstract>

      <abstract>Stretched exponential relaxation, exp[?(t /tau)^beta], fits many relaxation processes in disordered and quenched electronic and molecular systems, but it is widely believed that this function has no microscopic basis, especially in the case of molecular relaxation. For electronic relaxation the appearance of the stretched exponential is often described in the context of dispersive transport, where beta iis treated as an adjustable parameter, but in almost all cases it is generally assumed that no microscopic meaning can be assigned to 0 &lt; beta(T) &lt; 1 even at T = Tg, a glass transition temperature. We show that for molecular relaxation beta(Tg) can be understood, providing that one separates extrinsic and intrinsic effects, and that the intrinsic effects are dominated by two magic numbers, beta_SR = 3/5 for short-range forces, and beta_K = 3/7 for long-range Coulomb forces, as originally observed by Kohlrausch for the decay of residual charge on a Leyden jar. Our mathematical model treats relaxation kinetics using the Lifshitz? Kac?Luttinger diffusion to traps depletion model in a configuration space of effective dimensionality, the latter being determined using axiomatic set theory and Phillips?Thorpe constraint theory. The experiments discussed include ns neutron scattering experiments, particularly those based on neutron spin echoes which measure S(Q, t) directly, and the traditional linear response measurements which span the range from µs to s, as collected and analysed phenomenologically by Angell, Ngai, B¨ohmer and others. The electronic materials discussed include a-Si:H, granular C60, semiconductor nanocrystallites, charge density waves in TaS3, spin glasses, and vortex glasses in high-temperature semiconductors. The molecular materials discussed include polymers, network glasses, electrolytes and alcohols, Van der Waals supercooled liquids and glasses, orientational glasses, water, fused salts, and heme proteins. In the intrinsic cases the theory of beta(Tg) is often accurate to 2%, which is often better than the quoted experimental accuracies  5%. The extrinsic cases are identified by explicit structural signatures which are discussed at length. The discussion also includes recent molecular dynamical simulations for metallic glasses, spin glasses, quasicrystals and polymers which have achieved the intermediate relaxed Kohlrausch state and which have obtained values of beta in excellent agreement with the prediction of the microscopic theory.</abstract>

      <abstract>A classical electrodynamic near field calculation for the interaction of a Drude oscillator molecular dipole with a rough metal surface is presented. Effects of electromagnetic coupling between surface bumps (assumed to be prolate hemispheroids) and the bulk metal are included. Fluorescence lifetimes are found to be two to four orders of magnitude smaller than those predicted for a flat plane in calculations on silver, and for sufficiently short distances, an avoided crossing splitting is predicted.</abstract>

      <abstract>Nonradiative energy transfer from excited dye molecules near a metal surface to plasmon surface polaritons has been investigated experimentally. By using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique, the molecule-metal separation was varied and the coupling efficiency measured with the inverse attenuated-total-reflection technique. For an orientation of the transition dipole moment of the dye parallel to a silver surface and nonresonant interaction, maximum energy transfer to plasmon surface polaritons was observed for a molecule-silver spacing of about 18 nm. Reducing the spacing results in a monotonic decrease of the coupling efficiency: this decay channel becomes unimportant and eventually vanishes if the molecule is placed very close to the metal surface. The experimental results are discussed in connection with theoretical predictions and the surface-enhanced Raman scattering observed for some adsorbates at metal surfaces.</abstract>

      <abstract>Optical properties of fractal nanostructured composite materials are considered. The fractal geom- etry results in localization of plasmon excitations in the ?hot? spots, where the local field can exceed the applied field by several orders of magnitude. The high local fields of the localized fractal modes result in dramatic enhancement of optical responses, making feasible the surface-enhanced nonlinear spectroscopy of single mol- ecules and nanocrystals. The field enhancement becomes especially large when fractals are placed inside a microcavity. A theory for the enhanced Raman and hyper-Raman surface-enhanced scattering in microcavity? fractal composites is developed.</abstract>

      <abstract>Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) from a self-affine surface is shown to be very large. A theory is developed expressing this SERS in terms of the eigenmodes of a self-affine surface; the theory successfully explains the observed SERS from cold-deposited thin films that are known to have a self-affine structure. Spatial distributions of local fields at the fundamental and Stokes frequencies are strongly inhomogeneous and contain hot zones (high-field areas) localized in nanometer-sized regions that can be spatially separated for the two waves.</abstract>

      <abstract>Definitive data on the absorption spectrum of pure water from 380 to 700 nm have been obtained with an integrating cavity technique. The results are in good agreement with those recently obtained by our group with a completely independent photothermal technique. As before, we find that the absorption in the blue is significantly lower than had previously been generally believed and that the absorption minimum is at a significantly shorter wavelength, i.e., 0.0044 -/+ 0.0006 m-1 at 418 nm. Several spectroscopic features have been identified in the visible spectrum to our knowledge for the first time.</abstract>

      <abstract>Immunoprobes which incorporate both a fluorescent label and a 1.4 nm gold cluster compound were prepared by covalent conjugation to Fab antibody fragments of the Nanogold cluster label followed by a fluorescent moiety. These new immunoconjugates allow the collection of two complementary sets of data, from fluorescence and electron microscopy, from a single labeling experiment. By using Fab fragments, the entire probe is smaller than a whole IgG molecule. A simple fluorescence assay was used to investigate the fluorescence properties of the new probes. They were used to localize the pre-mRNA splicing factor SC35 in the HeLa cell nucleus by both fluorescence and electron microscopy, and also for labeling leukocyte microtubules; labeling was imaged using fluorescence microscopy and, after silver enhancement, by a variety of optical methods and by electron microscopy. Combined Nanogold and Texas Red, Cy3, Lissamine Rhodamine B, and AMCA probes were also prepared, and in preliminary experiments show similar properties to the combined fluorescein and gold cluster probes. The fluorescent and gold cluster probes enable a new degree of correlation between fluorescence and electron microscopy, and may also be used to check labeling of specimens before processing for electron microscopy.</abstract>

      <abstract>Immunoprobes that combine a fluorescent label with a 1.4-nm gold cluster compound have been prepared by covalent conjugation with polyclonal antibody Fab' fragments. These new immunoconjugates allow the collection of two complementary sets of data, from fluorescence and electron microscopy, from a single labeling experiment. We find that incorporation of one or more fluorescein moieties into the coordinated ligands of the 1.4-nm Nanogold gold cluster label yields a stable, dual-function immunolabel in which fluorescence quenching is negligible. In a second synthetic strategy, Nanogold and fluorescein were separately covalently conjugated to Fab' fragments to yield a probe with very similar properties. With the use of Fab' fragments, the entire probe is smaller than a whole IgG molecule, and it exhibited excellent penetration properties. It was used to localize the pre-mRNA splicing factor SC35 in the HeLa cell nucleus by both fluorescence and electron microscopy.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present a microscopic model for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) from molecules adsorbed on small noble-metal nanoparticles. In the absence of direct overlap of molecular orbitals and electronic states in the metal, the main enhancement source is the strong electric field of the surface plasmon resonance in a nanoparticle acting on a molecule near the surface. In small particles, the electromagnetic enhancement is strongly modified by quantum-size effects. We show that, in nanometer-sized particles, SERS magnitude is determined by a competition between several quantum-size effects such as the Landau damping of surface plasmon resonance and reduced screening near the nanoparticle surface. Using time-dependent local density approximation, we calculate spatial distribution of local fields near the surface and enhancement factor for different nanoparticles sizes.</abstract>

      <abstract>We study finite-size effects in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) from molecules adsorbed on small metal particles. Within an electromagnetic description of SERS, the enhancement of the Raman signal originates from the local field of the surface plasmon resonance in a nanoparticle. With decreasing particle sizes, this enhancement is reduced due to the size-dependent Landau damping of the surface plasmon. We show that, in small noble-metal particles, the reduction of interband screening in the surface layer leads to an additional increase in the local field acting on a molecule close to the metal surface. The overall size dependence of Raman signal enhancement is determined by the interplay between Landau damping and underscreening effects. Our calculations, based on a two-region model, show that the role of the surface layer increases for smaller nanoparticle sizes due to a larger volume fraction of the underscreened region.</abstract>

      <abstract>A microscopic approach to surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) from molecules adsorbed on noble-metal nanoparticles is developed. For nanoparticle sizes smaller than 10 nm, the classical electromagnetic enhancement mechanism is modified by quantum-size effects. Using time-dependent local field approximation, we perform systematic analysis of SERS in nanometer-sized Ag nanoparticles. We find that, in small nanoparticles, Raman cross-section enhancement is governed by the interplay between Landau damping of the surface plasmon and interband screening in the nanoparticle surface layer.</abstract>

This core streptavidin is proteolyzed at both ends at points that correspond closely with the termini of hen egg white avidin. Core streptavidin is more soluble than is the parent molecule. We have grown three different types of crystals of core streptavidin. The symmetry properties of these crystals prove that the molecule is a tetramer organized in tetrahedral (D2) point symmetry. The crystallographic response to the interaction of biotin with core streptavidin indicates that some conformational change accompanies ligand binding. We are attempting to determine the three-dimensional structure of streptavidin and its complex with selenobiotin from these crystals of core streptavidin.</abstract>

      <abstract>The incorporation of metal nanoparticles with various size and shapes provides silica gels with optical functionalities arising from the characteristic optical properties of the starting nanoparticle dispersions. The uniform distribution of the preformed nanoparticles and their mutual separation within the gels are key factors to maintain single-particle properties. These requirements are achieved by coating the nanoparticles with thin silica shells, which greatly enhance their stability and ensure separation between metal nanoparticle cores. The great advantage of this procedure is its ability to use nanoparticles with tailored shapes and thus to expand the possible functionalities to be implemented. We show the incorporation of gold nanorods with varying aspect ratio, which allows to have well-defined absorption bands even in the near infrared.</abstract>

      <abstract>Light scattering and absorption by spherical particles is extended to aggregates of spheres with arbitrary shape and size. We applied the theory of Gérardy and Ausloos [Phys. Rev. B 25, 4204-4229 (1082)] tocompute the total extinction loss spectra of several aggregates of nanometer-sized silver spheres from thenear IR to the near UV. Silver was best suited to provide quantitative comparison with experiments concerning the scattering and absorption in the visible spectral region. Additional resonant extinction was obtained besides the resonant extinction of the single silver sphere. The spectra were discussed in detail to give general results that are independent of the particle material.</abstract>

      <abstract>Many-particle systems exhibit unique optical properties which strongly depend on the arrangement of the individual particles in the sample. Novel methods were applied to produce gold particle samples with their arrangements systematically varying from statistical disorder to densely packed particle aggregates of various mean sizes and shapes. Their optical extinction spectra vary from narrow bands in the VIS to broad multiple band structures extending into the IR, the peak structure proving to be more pronounced if the particles are larger. Numerical calculations of explicit extinction spectra were performed on corresponding prototypic particle aggregates taking both interior and exterior retardation effects into account. In special, for aggregates of 2 to 5 particles, respectively, definite attachments of measured extinction peaks to special aggregate types were achieved from these calculations and confirmed by TEM micrographs of the investigated samples.</abstract>

      <abstract>The influence of plasma resonance coupling in small Au particle pairs on their optical properties was calculated including retardation effects. The latter prove to be important for sizes above 15 nm. For pairs of smaller particles a Maxwell-Garnett formula is derived and absorption spectra are calculated explicitly. Comparison with optical absorption spectra measured on aggregated Au particle hydrosols, gives good agreement concerning the splitting up of the dipolar single-particle plasma resonance band.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present optical investigations on the conformation of oligonucleotide layers on Au surfaces. Our studies concentrate on the effect of varying surface coverage densities on the structural properties of layers of 12- and 24mer single-stranded DNA, tethered to the Au surface at one end while being labeled with a fluorescent marker at the opposing end. The distance-dependent energy transfer from the marker dye to the metal surface, which causes quenching of the observed fluorescence, is used to provide information on the orientation of the DNA strands relative to the surface. Variations in the oligonucleotide coverage density, as determined from electrochemical quantification, over 2 orders of magnitude are achieved by employing different preparation conditions. The observed enhancement in fluorescence intensity with increasing DNA coverage can be related to a model involving mutual steric interactions of oligonucleotides on the surface, as well as fluorescence quenching theory. Finally, the applicability of the presented concepts for investigations of heterogeneous monolayers is demonstrated by means of studying the coadsorption of mercaptohexanol onto DNA-modified Au surfaces.</abstract>

      <abstract>Abstract: Molecular sensors based on scattering spectroscopy of single gold nanoparticles can be improved three-fold by the use of gold nanoshells instead of solid gold nanoparticles. The particle plasmon resonance responds more sensitively to changes in the environment, the biological spectral window is accessible, and the scattering spectra show sharper resonances. In particular, we focus our discussion on the narrow homogeneous line width of only 180 meV.</abstract>

      <abstract>A method for biomolecular recognition is reported using light scattering of a single gold nanoparticle functionalized with biotin. Addition of streptavidin and subsequent specific binding events alter the dielectric environment of the nanoparticle, resulting in a spectral shift of the particle plasmon resonance. As we use single nanoparticles showing a homogeneous scattering spectrum, spectral shifts as small as 2 meV can be detected.</abstract>

      <abstract>Laser induced fluorescence studies of single-strand (ss) DNA hybridization based on fluorescence quenching by gold nanoparticle through a distant dependent process has been carried out. Distance- and size-dependent optical absorption properties have been described using extended Mie calculations and compared with the experimental findings. The fluorescence of ss-DNA increases by a factor of 100 when it binds to a complimentary DNA while the addition of single-base mismatch DNA had no effect on the fluorescence efficiency. The mechanism of distant dependence fluorescence quenching has been discussed and our experimental results match reasonably well with the theoretical findings using fluorescence quenching model by Gersten and Nitzan.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper presents calculations of the electronic polarizabilities of very small metallic particles and of very thin metallic films. The theoretical model we employ for the metallic particle is simply that of N free electrons trapped by an infinitely deep spherical potential well. The model used for the thin-film problem is that of a system of free electrons constrained to move in the volume enclosed by two infinite parallel planes. Linear-response theory and Poisson's equation are used to calculate the electronic polarizability in terms of the electronic density-density response function. The numerical results provide an idea of just how small, or how thin, a small metallic particle, or thin metallic film, has to be for it to begin to lose its bulk property of being able to screen an externally applied electric field.</abstract>

      <abstract>Single-molecule atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the mechanical properties of titin, the giant sarcomeric protein of striated muscle. Individual titin molecules were repeatedly stretched, and the applied force was recorded as a function of the elongation. At large extensions, the restoring force exhibited a sawtoothlike pattern, with a periodicity that varied between 25 and 28 nanometers. Measurements of recombinant titin immunoglobulin segments of two different lengths exhibited the same pattern and allowed attribution of the discontinuities to the unfolding of individual immunoglobulin domains. The forces required to unfold individual domains ranged from 150 to 300 piconewtons and depended on the pulling speed. Upon relaxation, refolding of immunoglobulin domains was observed.</abstract>

      <abstract>Some unique events have occurred in the last few years which might revolutionize the field of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. While it was widely recognized that such matrices could normally be cast with a small pore size distribution, typically of the order of a few nanometers diameter (for protein sieving), recent developments suggest that "macroporous" gels could also be produced in the domain of polyacrylamides. If constraints to chain motion are imposed during gel polymerization, large-pore structures can be grown. Such constraints can originate either from low temperatures or from the presence of preformed polymers in the gelling solution; in both cases, the growing chains are forced to "laterally aggregate" via inter-chain hydrogen bond formation. Upon consumption of pendant double bonds, such bundles are frozen in the three-dimensional space by permanent cross-links. As an additional development, a novel photopolymerization system is described, comprising a cationic dye (methylene blue) and a redox couple (sodium toluene sulfinate, a reducer, and diphenyliodonium chloride, a mild oxidizer). Methylene blue catalysis is characterized by a unique efficiency, ensuring&gt;96% conversion of monomers, even in hydro-organic solvents and in the presence of surfactants, which normally quench or completely inhibit the persulphate-driven reaction. In addition, methylene blue-sustained photopolymerization can be operated in the entire pH 3-10 interval, where most other systems fail. Perhaps the most striking novelty in the field is the appearance of a novel monomer (N-acryloylaminopropanol, AAP) coupling a high hydrophilicity with a unique resistance to alkaline hydrolysis. Given the fact that a poly(AAP) matrix is 500 times more stable than a poly(acrylamide) gel, while being twice as hydrophilic, it is anticipated that this novel chemistry will have no difficulties in replacing the old electrophoretic anticonvective media. The review ends with a glimpse at novel sieving media in capillary zone electrophoresis: polymer networks. Such media, by providing an almost infinite range of pore sizes, due to the absence of a rigid support, allow sieving mechanisms to be operative over a wide interval of particle sizes, even up to genomic DNA. Viscous solutions of polymer networks, made with the novel poly(AAP) chemistry, allow repeated use of the same separation column, well above 50 injections. Silica-bound poly(AAP) chains provide effective quenching of electrosmosis and&gt;200 analyses by isoelectric focusing.</abstract>

      <abstract>We show how to change optically the distance between two protein-linked gold nanoparticles by Raman-induced motion of the linker protein. Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy of the coupled-particle plasmon allows us to compare the inter-nanoparticle distance of individual protein-linked gold nanoparticle dimers before and after surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). We find that low-intensity (50 W/m2) laser light in resonance with the nanoparticle-dimer plasmon provokes a change of the inter-nanoparticle distance on the order of 0.5 nm whenever SERS from the proteins connecting the nanoparticles can be observed.</abstract>

      <abstract>We apply two- and three-dimensional numerical calculations to study optical nanoantennae made of two coupled gold nanostructures, enclosing a single emitter in their gap. We show that, using structures manufacturable with today's nanotechnology, it is possible to increase the radiative decay rate by three orders of magnitude while keeping a quantum efficiency larger than 80% in the near-infrared regime. We examine the competition between the radiative and nonradiative processes in the presence of the antennae as a function of wavelength and antenna geometry. Our results hold great promise for improving the quantum efficiency of poor emitters such as silicon nanocrystals or carbon nanotubes.</abstract>

      <abstract>The response of gold nanoparticle dimers is studied theoretically near and beyond the limit where the particles are touching. As the particles approach each other, a dominant dipole feature is observed that is pushed into the infrared due to interparticle coupling and that is associated with a large pileup of induced charge in the interparticle gap. The redshift becomes singular as the particle separation decreases. The response weakens for very small separation when the coupling across the interparticle gap becomes so strong that dipolar oscillations across the pair are inhibited. Lowerwavelength, higher-order modes show a similar separation dependence in nearly touching dimers. After touching, singular behavior is observed through the emergence of a new infrared absorption peak, also accompanied by huge charge pileup at the interparticle junction, if initial interparticle-contact is made at a single point. This new mode is distinctly different from the lowest mode of the separated dimer. When the junction is made by contact between flat surfaces, charge at the junction is neutralized and mode evolution is continuous through contact. The calculated singular response explains recent experiments on metallic nanoparticle dimers and is relevant in the design of nanoparticle-based sensors and plasmon circuits.</abstract>

      <abstract>The decay of an excited molecule near a small metal sphere is considered from the viewpoint of electromagnetic theory. The total decay rate of the emitting dipole is obtained by considering the two mechanisms through which energy is dissipated. One is the radiative loss, which is calculated from the Poynting vector, and the other is the nonradiative decay which is calculated from the Ohmic losses inside the sphere. Numerical computations are performed for the case of a molecule near a small silver sphere, and the results are compared with those for a molecule near the planar boundary of a silver half-space.

      <abstract>We report on scanning near-field optical microscopy of one-dimensional chains of gold nanoparticles which are optically excited at their particle plasmon frequency under total internal reflection. Shape and mutual distance of the nanoparticles are tailored by lithographic fabrication. We show that the optical near-field profiles are determined by two contributions. First, the particle plasmon near-field and second, interference patterns due to the interaction of the exciting light wave and diffracted radiative grating orders. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

      <abstract>Modifying colloidal gold particles with DNA is a new interesting approach in the development of genetic biosensors. Normally the modification is designed to consist of a covalent gold-sulfur bond mediated by a thiol group on one end of a single-stranded oligonucleotide. Here we investigate to what extent the binding actually consists of only the sulfur bridge or if some other nonspecific binding mechanism is present as well. We report on an electrophoresis study showing high amounts of strong, non-thiol-mediated (nonspecific) binding of both single- and double-stranded DNA to gold nanoparticles. Interestingly, even the double strands, lacking interacting groups from the exposed bases of single-stranded DNA, interact nonspecifically with the gold particles. We suggest the mechanism for this to be ion-induced dipole dispersive interactions, where the negatively charged phosphate groups on the DNA induce dipoles in the highly polarizable gold particles. Moreover, we show that particles with nonspecifically adsorbed DNA can be separated from the specifically modified and unmodified ones by gel electrophoresis.</abstract>

      <abstract>The adsorption of 2-amino-4-methylbenzothiazole (2-AMBT) on colloidal silver particles has been investigated by a surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) study. The SERS spectra of the 2-AMBT molecule at varied adsorbate concentrations recorded in different time domains are compared with its Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum and normal Raman spectrum (NRS) in the bulk and in solution. The experimentally observed SERS spectra are compared with the theoretically modeled surface complexes using ab initio restricted Hatree-Fock (RHF) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The most favorable adsorptive sites of the 2-AMBT molecule have been estimated by natural population analysis (NPA) using the above-mentioned high level of theories. The enhancement of the in-plane modes together with the appearance of Ag-N stretching frequency at 215 cm-1 indicates that the 2-AMBT molecule is adsorbed on the silver surface through the lone pair electrons of both nitrogen atoms with the molecular plane nearly vertical to the surface.</abstract>

      <abstract>Surface-enhanced resonant Raman scattering (SERRS) spectra of Rhodamine 6G (R6G) were acquired from single (aggregated) Ag colloidal particles that had been incubated with various amounts of R6G (0.1-125 nM). The spectra were investigated in detail and the evidence for a single-molecule-like response was found even for R6G:Ag particle ratios greatly exceeding equimolarity. After a thorough comparison with literature data, it is concluded that it is reasonable to expect a single-molecule-like response even for fairly ?high? R6G concentrations. A series of Raman images are shown and commented on with respect to bulk SERRS measurements. The problem of band assignment of single-molecule spectra of biological species is addressed.

      <abstract>Single-molecule spectroscopy in water has been investigated by monitoring the dynamical behaviour of the electron transfer reaction between guanosine-containing oligonucleotides and the covalently attached oxazine dye MR121, using diode laser based far-field fluorescence microscopy. In this system, each oligonucleotide molecule exhibits multiexponential electron transfer kinetics. The influence of the guanosine position on the degree of quenching is shown using different oligonucleotide sequences. The dynamical behaviour of conformational transitions between various states with different electron transfer efficiency is monitored by time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy on the s- and ms-time scales. In addition, guanosine specific on/off blinking of individual labeled oligonucleotide molecules in aqueous solution is shown.</abstract>

      <abstract>The increased sensitivity together with the advent of low-cost optical sources and detectors in the visible-near IR region has led us to current efforts to develop new efficient fluorescent labels for biodiagnostics with absorption and emission beyond 600 nm. In view of the general fluorescence decrease with increasing emission wavelength, we investigated the possibility to shift the absorption of rhodamine dyes toward the region 620-670 nm. The hydrophobic nature of all known long-wavelength dyes results in the tendency to form intra- and intermolecular aggregates in hydrophilic solvents, especially in aqueous environment. Due to the aggregation with biological materials, fluorescence quenching of the dyes is often observed. New strategies for prevention of these processes are considered.</abstract>

      <abstract>In attempting to analyze, on digital computers, data from basically continuous physical experiments, numerical methods of performing familiar operations must be developed. The operations of differentiation and filtering are especially important both as an end in themselves, and as a prelude to further treatment of the data. Numerical counterparts of analog devices that perform these operations, such as RC filters, are often considered. However, the method of least squares may be used without additional computational complexity and with considerable improvement in the informotion obtained. The least squares calculations may be carried out in the computer by convolution of the data points with properly chosen sets of integers. These sets of integers and their normalizing factors are described and their use is illustrated in spectroscopic applications. The computer programs required are relatively simple. Two examples are presented as subroutines in the FORTRAN language.</abstract>

      <abstract>We propose a model for porous silicon, an irregular structure obtained by removing some silicon atoms randomly from a perfect silicon crystal. It is shown by using two-dimensional clusters with a tight-binding model that this model exhibits the energy-gap widening and the nonexponential decay of the photoluminescence (PL), which are in good agreement with the observed properties of porous silicon. In this model, the energy-gap widening is due to the localization of eigenstates caused by the randomness of the structure. The distributions in both size and position of the localized eigenstates, i.e., a statistical effect, yield nonexponential PL decay which is describable by the stretched exponential function. A dynamical effect due to electron and hole hopping between the eigenstates explains the observed strong energy dependence of the PL lifetimes.</abstract>

      <abstract>An unprecedented small thioaurite cluster compound (with metallic Au0 core) has been isolated in high yield by decomposition of polymeric Au(I)SG compounds, where GSH is the ubiquitous tripeptide glutathione, N-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine. The Au:SG clusters appear to share the high stability and robustness of their hydrophobic n-alkyl analogues but are highly water soluble. The most abundant cluster produced by these methods can be easily separated from its homologues by gel electrophoresis. Its total molecular weight is ca. 10.4 kDa, and the mass of its strongly bound inorganic core is 5.6 kDa, suggesting the composition Au28(SG)16. This composition is also consistent with the X-ray diffraction pattern of the crystalline molecular solid. Distinct features in the optical absorption spectroscopy are inherently different from either larger clusters or smaller gold cluster compounds. The compound is optically active, as evidenced by circular dichroism in the near-IR, visible, and near-UV regions. The 13C NMR spectra suggest that the bonding environment of the GS-adsorbate is similar to that of the n-alkyl-adsorbate clusters, and the nonsulfhydryl properties are retained. The cluster is thus envisioned as a large metallic-cluster compound with distinctive optical properties encapsulated by a bioactive peptide monolayer.</abstract>

      <abstract>Ligand stabilized gold nanoparticles have attracted much attention in the search for new chemically designed compounds for a future information technology, based on single-electron devices. This article gives an overview about the strategies used to synthesize and to assemble uniform gold nanoparticles in different dimensions as well as about the present status of the electrical properties of these. Examples are given for three-dimensional organisations, for the formation of self-assembled monolayers as well as for one-dimensional assemblies.</abstract>

      <abstract>We report on the preparation, characterization, and photophysical study of new fluorescent core/shell nanoparticles fabricated by electrostatic layer-by-layer assembly. On the basis of gold cores with a diameter of 13 nm, these nanocolloids possess different fluorescently labeled polymer corona layers at various distances from the surface of the core metal using nonfluorescent polyelectrolytes as spacer layers. UV-visible spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirm that the particle suspensions of fluorescently labeled core/shell nanoparticles are stable at all stages of their construction. Photophysical investigations reveal strongly distance-dependent fluorescence quenching in these particle systems. The contribution of the metal core to this quenching can be assesed precisely after the gentle dissolution of the gold cores by potassium cyanide. The photophysical measurements reveal clearly that the gold nanoparticles decrease the transition probability for radiative transitions.</abstract>

      <abstract>We measure fluorescence lifetimes of emitters embedded in isolated single dielectric nanospheres. {B}y varying the diameters of the spheres from 100 nm to 2 $\mu$m and by modifying their dielectric surrounding, we demonstrate a systematic change of paradigm in the spontaneous emission rate, as we cross the border from the superwavelength regime of {M}ie resonances to the nanoscopic realm of {R}ayleigh scattering. {O}ur data show inhibition of the spontaneous emission up to 3 times and are in excellent agreement with the results of analytical calculations.</abstract>

      <abstract>We combine interferometric detection of single gold nanoparticles, single molecule microscopy, and fluorescence lifetime measurement to study the modification of the fluorescence decay rate of an emitter close to a nanoparticle. In our experiment, gold particles with a diameter of 15 nm were attached to single dye molecules via double-stranded DNA of different lengths. Nanoparticle-induced lifetime modification (NPILM) has promise in serving as a nanoscopic ruler for the distance range well beyond 10 nm, which is the upper limit of fluorescence resonant energy transfer (FRET). Furthermore, the simultaneous detection of single nanoparticles and fluorescent molecules presented in this work provides new opportunities for single molecule biophysical studies.</abstract>

      <abstract>Intermolecular static and dynamic fluorescence quenching constants of eight coumarin derivatives by nucleobase derivatives have been determined in aqueous media. One common sequence of the quenching efficiency has been found for the nucleobases. The feasibility of a photoinduced electron transfer reaction for the nucleobase-specific quenching of fluorescent dyes is investigated by the calculation of the standard free energy changes with the Rehm-Weller equation. A complete set of one-electron redox potential data for the nucleobases are determined electrochemically in aprotic solvents for the first time, which are compared with values obtained by various other methods. Depending on the redox properties of the fluorescent dyes, the sequences of the quenching efficiencies can be rationalized by the orders of electrochemical oxidation potentials (vs NHE) of nucleosides (dG (+1.47 V) &lt; dA &lt; dC dT &lt; U (&gt; +2.39 V)) and reduction potentials (dG (&lt; -2.76 V) &lt; dA &lt; dC &lt; dT &lt; U (-2.07 V)). The correlation between the intermolecular dynamic quenching constants and the standard free energy of photoinduced electron transfer according to the classical Marcus equation indicates that photoinduced electron transfer is the rate-limiting step. However, an additional, water-specific gain of free energy between -0.5 and -0.9 eV shows that additional effects, like a coupled proton transfer and a hydrophobic effect, have to be considered, too. Furthermore, the capability of the nucleobases to form ground state complexes with fluorescent dyes is influenced by their redox potentials. The relevance of these observations to current efforts for DNA sequencing with a detection by laser-induced fluorescence and their application to other dyes are discussed.</abstract>

      <abstract>Efforts to improve the performance of immunoassays and immunosensors by incorporating different kinds of nanostructures have gained considerable momentum over the last decade. Apart from liposomes, which will not be discussed here, most groups focus on artificial, particulate marker systems, both organic and inorganic. The underlying detection procedures may be based either on electro-magnetical or optical techniques. This review will be confined to the latter only, comprising nanoparticle applications generating signals as diverse as static and time-resolved luminescence, one- and two-photon absorption, Raman and Rayleigh scattering as well as surface plasmon resonance and others. In general, all endeavors cited are geared to achieve one or more of the following goals: lowering of detection limits (if possible, down to single-molecule level), parallel integration of multiple signals (multiplexing), signal amplification by several orders of magnitude and prevention of photobleaching effects with concomitant maintenance of antigen binding specificity and sensitivity. Inorganic nanoparticle labels based on noble metals, semiconductor quantum dots and nanoshells appear to be the most versatile systems for these bioanalytical applications of nanophotonics.

      <abstract>Surface-enhanced optical nonlinearities are studied in a semicontinuous film consisting of metal granules randomly distributed on an insulating substrate. The local fields are very inhomogeneous in such films and consist of strongly localized sharp peaks. In peaks (hot spots), the local fields exceed the applied field by several orders of magnitudes resulting in giant enhancements of the optical nonlinearities. Because of such a pattern for the local field distributions, the nonlinear signals are mostly generated from small nanometer-size areas. The corresponding spatial distributions for the generated fields form, in turn, a set of very sharp peaks on a homogeneous, on average, semicontinuous film. It is shown that the spatial positions of the localized hot spots at the fundamental and generated frequencies are located, in general, in different parts of a film. The local enhancements in the hot spots exceed the average enhancement by several orders of magnitude. The predicted giant local enhancements open fascinating possibilities in nonlinear spectroscopy of single molecules on a semicontinuous metal film. A number of surface-enhanced optical nonlinearities are studied, namely, those that are responsible for the Kerr-effect, four-wave mixing, second-, and third-harmonic generation. The enhancement for nonlinear optical processes is shown to strongly increase toward the long-wavelength part of the spectrum. Spatial distributions of the local fields are calculated in our broad-scale numerical simulations. A scaling theory for the high-order field moments is developed. It predicts that the moments of the local fields are very large and independent of the frequency in a wide spectral range. The theory predicts anomalous field fluctuations and giant enhancements for the nonlinear optical processes, from the visible to the far-infrared spectral range.</abstract>

      <abstract>Presented are the results of studies with 29 positively charged cyanine dyes that fluorimetrically respond to valinomycin-induced changes in the membrane potentials of red blood cell and phospholipid vesicle suspensions. Several of the dyes exhibit fluorescence changes in excess of 80% upon membrane hyperpolarization (inside becomes negative). The fluorescence response of the dyes is shown to result from potentialdependent partition of dye molecules between the cells and the extracellular medium. Cell hyperpolarization results in uptake of the dye molecules by the cells, while depolarization results in release of dye. The emission from cell-associated dye becomes significantly quenched as the amount of cell-associated dye increases. We present evidence that suggests that the quenching of cell-associated dye is due to formation of dye aggregates, which have reduced fluorescence.</abstract>

      <abstract>Raman scattering (in Russia called combination scattering) was discovered in 1928 by Indian and Russian scientists, at almost the same time. In 1930, the Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to the Indian scientist Sir C.V. Raman, F.R.S., while the Russian scientists G.S. Landsberg and L.I. Mandelstam were rejected. The reasons for this are illustrated by analysing the nomination letters for the three scientists, as well as the report of the Nobel Committee for the year 1930.</abstract>

      <abstract>Fluorescence enhancement was studied on silver colloidal metal films (CMFs) using two systems: (1) Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers of fluorescein-labeled phospholipids separated from the surface of the films by spacer layers of octadecanoic acid and (2) biotin-fluorescein conjugates captured by avidin molecules adsorbed on top of a multilayer structure formed by alternating layers of bovine serum albumin-biotin conjugate (BSA-biotin) and avidin. The dependence of fluorescence intensity on the number of lipid or protein spacer layers deposited on the surface of the CMF was investigated. The results demonstrate the requirement for adsorbate location within the region between Ag particles for maximal enhancement. The density of avidin molecules on the surface of the BSA-biotin/avidin multilayers adsorbed on the CMF was also determined. A procedure for forming a rigid, uniform silica layer around the Ag particles on the CMF is described. The layer protects the particles from undesirable chemical reactions such as etching by halide ions, for example, and provides the requisite stability for bioanalytical applications. Colloidal films composed of Ag particles covered by  10-nm-thick silica layers were tested for fluorescence enhancement using goat immunoglobulin and a conjugate of rabbit anti-goat immunoglobulin with 6-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)hexanoate. An enhancement factor of  20 was obtained.</abstract>

      <abstract>Gold nanoparticles manipulate the quantum efficiency of phosphorescent molecules, which are attached via biotin-streptavidin recognition at a distance of 4 nm to the nanoparticle surface. Time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy reveals an increase in the radiative as well as in the nonradiative rate of the phosphorescent molecules upon binding to gold nanoparticles. The increase in the radiative rate alone would lead to an increased luminescence quantum yield. However, this effect is outweighed by the distinct enhancement of the nonradiative rate due to energy transfer, resulting in an overall quenching of the luminescence.</abstract>

      <abstract>Nanoengineered fluorescent response is reported from semiconductor core-shell (CdSe/ZnS) quantum dots in proximity to the surface plasmon polariton field of periodic Ag nanoparticle arrays. Tuning the surface plasmon polariton resonance to the quantum dot exciton emission band results in an enhancement of up to  50-fold in the overall fluorescence efficiency, in a design where each Ag nanoparticle is interconnected by a continuous Ag thin film. Propagating modes of surface plasmon resonances have a direct impact on the fluorescence enhancement.</abstract>

      <abstract>In traditional DNA melting assays, the temperature of the DNA-containing solution is slowly ramped up. In contrast, we use 300 ns laser pulses to rapidly heat DNA bound gold nanoparticle aggregates. We show that double-stranded DNA melts on a microsecond time scale that leads to a disintegration of the gold nanoparticle aggregates on a millisecond time scale. A perfectly matching and a point-mutated DNA sequence can be clearly distinguished in less than one millisecond even in a 1:1 mixture of both targets.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present for the first time cavity-controlled fluorescence spectra and decay curves of single dipole emitters interacting at room temperature with the first longitudinal mode of a Fabry-Perot microcavity offering a ?/2-spacing between its silver mirrors. The spontaneous emission rate of individual dye molecules was found to be enhanced by the Purcell effect by up to three times compared to the rate in free space, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Moreover, our new microcavity design was found to provide long-term stability and single-molecule sensitivity under ambient conditions for several months without noticeable reduction of the cavity-Q value. We consider this as a significant advance for single-photon sources operating at room temperature.</abstract>

      <abstract>The binding affinity of deoxynucleosides (dA, dG, dC, and dT) to gold nanoparticles was studied using a colorimetric assay to determine if nucleobase sequence may play a role in binding alkanethiol-capped oligonucleotides to gold nanoparticles. These data indicate that the deoxynucleoside dT has a much lower binding affinity to the gold nanoparticle surface than the deoxynucleosides dG, dC, and dA. These data can be correlated with a previous study in our lab which indicated that alkanethiol-capped oligonucleotides containing (dT)20 spacers have a significantly higher surface coverage than oligonucleotides containing (dA)20 spacers. To probe the physical consequences of this phenomenon, gold nanoparticles were loaded with alkanethiol-capped poly dT, dA, and dC oligonucleotide sequences of 5-20 bases in length, and the stabilities of the particles in electrolytic media were measured by monitoring a colorimetric change associated with particle agglomeration. The gold nanoparticles loaded with alkanethiol-capped poly dT oligonucleotides exhibited a dramatic increase in stability as the oligonucleotide length was increased from 5 to 20 bases. By comparison, gold nanoparticles loaded with poly dC and poly dA sequences exhibited only a slight increase in stability as the oligonucleotide length was increased. The sequence-dependent stability observed for the DNA-modified gold nanoparticles is attributed to the weaker interaction of the deoxynucleoside dT with the gold nanoparticle surface which results in higher surface coverages and consequently enhanced stability as the oligonucleotide length is increased.</abstract>

      <abstract>Selective colorimetric polynucleotide detection based on Au nanoparticle probes which align in a "tail-to-tail" fashion onto a target polynucleotide is described. In this new nanoparticle-based detection system, Au particles ( 13 nm diameter), which are capped with 3'- and 5'-(alkanethiol)oligonucleotides, are used to complex a 24-base polynucleotide target. Hybridization of the target with the probes results in the formation of an extended polymeric Au nanoparticle/polynucleotide aggregate, which triggers a red to purple color change in solution. The color change is due to a red shift in the surface plasmon resonance of the Au nanoparticles. The aggregates exhibit characteristic, exceptionally sharp "melting transitions" (monitored at 260 or 700 nm), which allows one to distinguish target sequences that contain one base end mismatches, deletions, or an insertion from the fully complementary target. When test solutions are spotted onto a C18 reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography plate, color differentiation is enhanced and a permanent record of the test is obtained, thereby providing a better method for distinguishing the aforementioned target sequences. Significantly, one-pot colorimetric detection of the target in the presence of four strands with single base imperfections can be accomplished with this new probe system</abstract>

      <abstract>In this review, we focus on some of the most successful approaches to date for organizing nanoparticles into macroscopic aggregates and functional materials. The preparation and resulting properties of two- and three-dimensional arrays of nanoparticles are detailed, and some potential uses for these materials are discussed. Although many types of nanoparticles can be organized into such structures, this review focuses specifically on Au and CdE (E=S, Se) nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles are easily prepared, highly stable, well-studied, and excellent models for other metal colloids. CdE colloids are the most extensively studied semiconductor nanoparticles and hold much promise in the optoelectronics field.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this work we report on the so-called plasmonic enhancement effect, whereby the presence of metallic surfaces or particles in the vicinity of a fluorophore can dramatically alter the fluorescence emission and absorption properties of a fluorophore. The effect, which is associated with the surface plasmon resonance of the metallic surface, depends on parameters such as metal type, particle size, fluorophore type, and fluorophore-particle separation. This work focuses on the creation of metal nanoparticle arrays by a lithographic process and on optimisation strategies to maximise the fluorescence enhancement of dyes in the vicinity of the nanoparticles, for important applications such as fluorescence-based biochip platforms. Ordered arrays of metallic nano-islands were fabricated on glass substrates by a process of natural lithography using monodisperse polystyrene nanospheres. The metal particle dimensions were tailored in order to tune the plasmon resonance wavelength to match the spectral absorption of the fluorophore. The fluorophore, Cy5 dye, which is widely used in optical immunoassays and has a medium quantum efficiency (similar to 0.3), was used in this preliminary study of the plasmonic enhancement effect. The morphology of the metallic arrays was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Absorption and emission spectroscopies were used to elucidate the enhancement effect and its dependence on metal island morphology. Results were correlated with existing theoretical models. The applicability of this important technique to sensor platforms, such as fluorescence-based biochips, is also discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</abstract>

      <abstract>The collaborative oscillation of conductive electrons in metal nanoparticles results in a surface plasmon resonance that makes them useful for various applications including biolabeling. We investigate the coupling between pairs of elliptical metal particles by simulations and experiments. The results demonstrate that the resonant wavelength peak of two interacting particles is red-shifted from that of a single particle because of near-field coupling. It is also found that the shift decays approximately exponentially with increasing particle spacing and become negligible when the gap between the two particles exceeds about 2.5 times the particle short-axis length.</abstract>

      <abstract>We investigated fluorescence imaging using a near-field scanning optical microscope which uses a laser-stabilized gold nanoparticle as a near-field probe. This microscope is suitable for observations of biological specimens in aqueous solutions because the probe particle is held by a noncontact force exerted by a laser beam. Theoretical calculations based on Mie scattering theory are presented to evaluate the near-field enhancement by a gold particle of 40 nm diameter. We also present fluorescence images of a single fluorescent bead and discuss the near-field contribution to the fluorescence image in this type of microscope.</abstract>

      <abstract>We have studied the laser-excitation-intensity-dependent and Ag-nanocluster interstitial-site-dependent SERS intensity fluctuations under low molecule surface coverage of rhodamine 6G and cytochrome c. A new two-channel photon time-stamping system coupled with atomic force microscopic (AFM), Raman spectroscopic, and imaging microscopy was developed and applied to record Raman intensity fluctuation trajectories at sub-microsecond resolution correlated with in situ characterization of the nanoparticle clusters. Our experimental results suggest that the nanoconfinement of the local electromagnetic-field enhancement and the interaction of the local field with the molecules, presumably under rotational motions, result in nano-Raman fluctuations. The SERS spectral fluctuation was pertinent to the nanoscale local enhancement and local interaction of the molecules with the surface when the surface coverage of the nanoparticles was less than a monolayer, and the nanoscale interstitial space controlled the finite number of molecules to contribute the microscopic Raman signal collected from a diffraction-limited focus spot. The fluctuation amplitude significantly decreased with the number of molecules confined at the nanolocal field. The nano-SERS fluctuation dynamics were both photo-induced and spontaneous for rhodamine 6G, but only the photo-induced component was observable for cytochrome c. The fluctuation dynamics were also found to be highly inhomogeneous at interstitial sites with heterogeneous geometries. To interpret the observed nano-SERS fluctuation dynamics, we used computer simulation of optical multiple scattering, based on multi-sphere scattering Mie theory, and rotational diffusion of molecules at an interstitial site, based on a random walk in orientation space.</abstract>

The presence of the cavity causes great modifications in the emission spectrum and emission intensity in the direction of the cavity axis. A clear change in spontaneous emission lifetime occurs, which is also attributed to the microcavity effect.</abstract>

      <abstract>This contribution reports on the combination of optical tweezers with SERS spectroscopy of colloidal silver nanoparticles covered by thiophenol. The experimental design is based on two different laser beams, one used for Raman excitation (lambda = 514.5 nm) and one for optical tweezing (lambda = 830 nm). For a fixed Raman excitation power, the SERS signal from thiophenol is found to increase dramatically when the trapping laser is activated. This result is interpreted as a combination of two effects, an accumulation of nanoparticles in the optical trap and an optically induced aggregation of these nanoparticles.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present a new scheme for near-field fluorescence imaging using a metal tip illuminated with femtosecond laser pulses of proper polarization. The strongly enhanced electric field at the metal tip (   15 nm end diameter) results in a localized excitation source for molecular fluorescence. Excitation of the sample via two-photon absorption provides good image contrast due to the quadratic intensity dependence. The spatial resolution is shown to be better than that of the conventional aperture technique. We used the technique to image fragments of photosynthetic membranes, as well as J-aggregates with spatial resolutions on the order of 20 nm.</abstract>

      <abstract>We have developed a simple, fast, and flexible technique to measure optical scattering spectra of individual metallic nanoparticles. The particles are placed in an evanescent field produced by total internal reflection of light from a halogen lamp in a glass prism. The light scattered by individual particles is collected using a conventional microscope and is spectrally analyzed by a nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled-device array coupled to a spectrometer. This technique is employed to measure the effect of particle diameter on the dephasing time of the particle plasmon resonance in gold nanoparticles. We also demonstrate the use of this technique for measurements in liquids, which is important for the potential application of particle plasmons in chemical or biological nanosensors.</abstract>

      <abstract>Forster Resonance Energy Transfer has served as a molecular ruler that reports conformational changes and intramolecular distances of single biomolecules(1-4). However, such rulers suffer from low and fluctuating signal intensities, limited observation time due to photobleaching, and an upper distance limit of similar to 10 nm. Noble metal nanoparticles have plasmon resonances in the visible range and do not blink or bleach. They have been employed as alternative probes to overcome the limitations of organic fluorophores(5,6), and the coupling of plasmons in nearby particles has been exploited to detect particle aggregation by a distinct color change in bulk experiments(7-9). Here we demonstrate that plasmon coupling can be used to monitor distances between single pairs of gold and silver nanoparticles. We followed the directed assembly of gold and silver nanoparticle dimers in real time and studied the kinetics of single DNA hybridization events. These 'plasmon rulers' allowed us to continuously monitor separations of up to 70 nm for &gt;3,000 s.</abstract>

      <abstract>Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) intensities for individual Au nanospheres, nanoshells, and nanosphere and nanoshell dimers coated with nonresonant molecules are measured, where the precise nanoscale geometry of each monomer and dimer is identified through in situ atomic force microscopy. The observed intensities correlate with the integrated quartic local electromagnetic field calculated for each specific nanostructure geometry. In this study, we find that suitably fabricated nanoshells can provide SERS enhancements comparable to nanosphere dimers.</abstract>

      <abstract>Abstract: Metallic nanoparticles are known to dramatically modify the spontaneous emission of nearby fluorescent molecules and materials. Here we examine the role of the nanoparticle plasmon resonance energy and nanoparticle scattering cross section on the fluorescence enhancement of adjacent indocyanine green (ICG) dye molecules. We find that enhancement of the molecular fluorescence by more than a factor of 50 can be achieved for ICG next to a nanoparticle with a large scattering cross section and a plasmon resonance frequency corresponding to the emission frequency of the molecule.</abstract>

      <abstract>Light scattering by individual Ag nanoparticles and structures have been studied spectroscopically. Individual particles were selected and manipulated with a micromanipulator installed inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM). With typical particle dimensions of some 100 nm, the plasma resonances of particles and the coupled modes of particle pairs were observed in the visible region. The polarization dependence of the resonance frequencies strongly reflects the shape anisotropy; the effect that would be averaged out for experiments on ensembles. With a simple approximation to take the glass substrate into account, the results are in good agreement with the analytical calculations by Mie scattering, and with numerical calculations by the finite-difference time-domain method, both of which are performed with the morphological parameters obtained from the SEM observation for the corresponding particle or particle pair.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present a resonant optical nanoantenna positioned at the end of a metal-coated glass fiber near-field probe. Antenna resonances, excitation conditions, and field localization are directly probed in the near field by single fluorescent molecules and compared to finite integration technique simulations. It is shown that the antenna is equivalent to its radio frequency analogue, the monopole antenna. For the right antenna length and local excitation conditions, antenna resonances occur that lead to an enhanced localized field near the antenna apex. Direct mapping of this field with single fluorescent molecules reveals a spatial localization of 25 nm, demonstrating the importance of such antennas for nanometer resolution optical microscopy.</abstract>

      <abstract>The spontaneous emission of a single molecule is substantially modified close to a metallic nanostructure. We study the spectral behavior of the radiative and nonradiative decay rates and of the local-field factor in the vicinity of a plasmon resonance. We show that the highest fluorescence enhancement is obtained for an emission wavelength redshifted from the plasmon resonance, and that quenching always dominates at plasmon resonance. These results may have experimental implications in spectroscopy and monitoring of elementary light sources.</abstract>

      <abstract>We report on confocal fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (CFLIM) of single dye molecules adsorbed on glass surface. Applying a short-pulse diode laser emitting at 635 nm with a repetition rate of 64 MHz we studied the time-resolved identification of individual carbocyanine and oxazine dyes via their characteristic fluorescence lifetimes of 2.06±0.37 ns (Cy5) and 3.89±0.91 ns (JA242). Fluctuations in fluorescence intensity and lifetime of individual adsorbed molecules were investigated with millisecond time resolution. These jumps exhibit short off-states off of 0.5 ms which can be ascribed to the triplet state lifetime under dry conditions with an intersystem crossing yield YISC of 0.2 other quantum jumps into longer lived states (several milliseconds) with lower transition probability were observed. The correlation of rotational and spectral jumps of single and coupled fluorophores with changes in the observed fluorescence lifetime are discussed.</abstract>

      <abstract>A new scanning technique for simultaneous recording of intensity, fluorescence lifetime, and spectral information with single molecule sensitivity is presented. We investigated and compared the photophysical parameters of single oxazine (JA242), rhodamine (JF9), and carbocyanine (Cy5) derivatives adsorbed on glass surfaces under air-equilibrated conditions. The obtained results demonstrate that spectrally resolved fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (SFLIM) is ideally suited to reveal subpopulations in inhomogeneous samples and mixtures. To obtain a more detailed insight into the underlying fluorescence dynamics of single molecules, the fluorescence characteristics of the three different chromophores were studied positioning isolated molecules in the laser focus. Two detectors with two PC plug-in cards for time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) were utilized to monitor fluorescence intensity, lifetime, and spectral information simultaneously with single-molecule sensitivity and microseconds to milliseconds time resolution. Discrete jumps in fluorescence intensity from single molecules which lacked spectral diffusion and changes in radiative lifetime have been observed with correlation times (triplet lifetimes) spanning several orders of magnitude (from 2 s for the rhodamine derivative up to several seconds for the oxazine dye) and amplitude. For the carbocyanine derivative Cy5, fast spectral fluctuations to red-shifted dim-states which appear partly as off-states with a lifetime in the millisecond range were determined. In addition, these dim-states exhibit the same radiative decay rate of  2 ns as the normal on-state. Our results imply that a direct correlation between the radiative decay time and spectral fluctuations is not necessarily given in each of the three chromophores. Both parameters seem to be independent characteristic of each individual molecule. About 5-15 structure, respectively, exhibited a constant emission spectrum but strong fluctuations in fluorescence lifetime directly correlated to the intensity. The results indicate that a combined analysis of emission spectrum, intensity and radiative decay rate is a valuable approach for classification and quantification of the underlying photophysical dynamics.</abstract>

      <abstract>Raman spectra of anhydrous complexes of streptavidin (Strep) with biotin (Bio) and some Bio analogues [Biotin methyl ester (MEBio), desthiobiotin (DEBio), 2?-iminobiotin (IMBio), and diaminobiotin (DABio)] were recorded. The vibrational results indicate that the interaction with some of these ligands is able to modify the overall structure of the protein and this binding results in a decrease in the &amp;bgr;sheet content and an increase in the &amp;agr;-helix content. To further confirm the conformational changes of the protein structure due to Bio analogue binding, the curve-fitting analysis of the amide I Raman band of neat Strep and of the complexes were performed. The intensity ratio of the components due to the &amp;bgr;-sheet and &amp;agr;-helix conformations decreased in the Strep-MEBio, Strep-IMBio (pH 11), and Strep-Bio systems, whereas in all the other systems the changes were not significant. This behavior differs from that of Avi bound to the same ligands and suggests that Strep and Avi differ in their binding selectivity. A good correlation was found between the secondary structure percentages of the Avi and of the Strep complexes and &amp;Dgr;G°. On the basis of this linear relationship, the vibrational results allow for an acceptable evaluation of the dissociation constants of the Strep complexes, not previously reported in the literature. The present results indicate a correlation between the type of interaction and the effects of the protein-substrate bonding on the overall structure of the proteins. The amino acid residues in the binding site appear to be positioned in a such a way as to provide a precise fit of Bio. Even slight change in the substrate structure causes a weakness in the strength of the binding. The vibrational results confirm that both the imidazolidinone and the thiophan rings are important in the Strep-Bio interactions, but the former is more responsible for the high affinity of the binding. One of the Tyr residues is hydrogen bound with the ureido ring and another Tyr could be involved in the binding pocket. Trp residues do not directly bind the ligand and probably stabilize other binding site residues which in turn interact directly with Bio.</abstract>

      <abstract>The fluorescence lifetime and the fluorescence rate of single molecules are recorded as a function of the position of a Si3N4 atomic force microscopy tip with respect to the molecule. We observe a decrease of the excited state lifetime and the fluorescence rate when the tip apex is in close proximity to the molecule. These effects are attributed to the fact that the dielectric tip converts non-propagating near-fields to propagating fields within the dielectric tip effectively quenching the fluorescence. The spatial extension of the quenching area is of subwavelength dimensions. The results are discussed in terms of molecular fluorescence in a system of stratified media. The experiment provides surprising new insights into the interactions between a fluorescent molecule and a dielectric tip. The methodology holds promise for applications in ultra high-resolution near-field optical imaging at the level of single fluorophores.</abstract>

      <abstract>The nano-optical interaction between a sharp tip and a single dipolar emitter is investigated. Changes of the excited state lifetime and the fluorescence rate of single molecules are recorded simultaneously as a function of the tip position relative to the molecule. A subdiffraction-limited area of decreased fluorescence and shortened lifetime is observed for gold-coated Si3N4 tips. The results are discussed in terms of molecular fluorescence in a system of stratified media. The outlined methodology holds promise for applications in ultrahigh-resolution near-field optical imaging at the level of single fluorophores.</abstract>

      <abstract>A new instrument, based on the principle of phase analysis light scattering (PALS) for the measurement of electrophoretic mobilities, has been produced. Such measurements are particularly useful in the study of dispersions in nonpolar and highly conducting media. The current PALS configuration can be used to measure mobilities up to 3 orders of magnitude lower than with the conventional Doppler mode. The device has a number of new features; in particular, all the signal processing is digital and the optical system features a reference beam configuration. Data are presented to show that on suitable samples both the PALS technique and conventional laser Doppler electrophoresis can be performed on the same instrument and the techniques are in good agreement.</abstract>

      <abstract>The giant muscle protein titin, also called connectin, is responsible for the elasticity of relaxed striated muscle, as well as acting as the molecular scaffold for thick-filament formation1,2. The titin molecule consists largely of tandem domains of the immuno-globulin and fibronectin-III types, together with specialized binding regions and a putative elastic region, the PEVK domain3. We have done mechanical experiments on single molecules of titin to determine their visco-elastic properties, using an optical-tweezers technique. On a fast (0.ls) timescale titin is elastic and force-extension data can be fitted with standard random-coil polymer models, showing that there are two main sources of elasticity: one deriving from the entropy of straightening the molecule; the other consistent with extension of the polypeptide chain in the PEVK region. On a slower timescale and above a certain force threshold, the molecule displays stress-relaxation, which occurs in rapid steps of a few piconewtons, corresponding to yielding of internal structures by about 20 nm. This stress-relaxation probably derives from unfolding of immu-noglobulin and fibronectin domains.</abstract>

      <abstract>After a preliminary survey with the electron microscope of various preparations of colloidal gold, a study was made of the process of nucleation and growth in gold colloids. It was shown that nucleating agents may be identified with reducing agents which form a mixed polymer with chlorauric ion before the reduction to the nucleus takes place. It was also shown that the law of growth is exponential. The average size, the deviation from the average size and the character of the particle size distribution curve are determined by the amount of gold, the nucleation process and the law of growth.</abstract>

      <abstract>Fluorescence steady-state and lifetime experiments have been carried out on duplex and single-stranded DNA molecules labeled at the 5' ends with 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TMRh). The temperature and ionic strength of the solutions were varied over large ranges. The results reveal at least three well-defined states of the TMRh-DNA molecules for the single-stranded as well as for the double-stranded DNA molecules. Two states are fluorescent, with lifetimes in the range of 0.5-1 ns and 2.5-3 ns. A third state of TMRh-DNA does not fluoresce (a dark species of TMRh-DNA). The distribution of the TMRh-DNA molecules among these three slates is strongly temperature and ionic strength dependent. Estimates are made of some reaction parameters of the multistate model. The results are discussed in terms of the photophysics of TMRh, and consequences of the multiple conformers of TMRh-DNA for studies involving fluorescence studies with TMRh-labeled DNA are considered.</abstract>

      <abstract>A phenomenological model is implemented to study the decay rates of fluorescing molecules in the vicinity of a metallic nanoparticle, wherein the nonlocal optical response of the particle is accounted for via the hydrodynamic model for the description of the free electrons in the metal. These nonlocal effects are examined for each of the radiative rate and the nonradiative rate of the admolecule, respectively. In addition, the overall fluorescence rate which includes the enhancement ratio for the driving field intensity is also studied. It is found that for particles of very small sizes (&lt;10 nm), the nonlocal effects, in general, lead to significantly greater fluorescence rates and smaller nonradiative decay rates for the admolecules, with the effects on radiative rates depending crucially on the orientation of the molecules. Furthermore, the effects are mostly noticeable for molecules close to the metal particle and in processes where higher multipolar interactions are significant such as those in nonradiative decay processes. Above all, these nonlocal effects can still be observable in the presence of large surface damping imposed on the metallic electrons due to the ultrasmall sizes of these nanoparticles. The relevance of these effects to some of the latest experiments is discussed.</abstract>

      <abstract>The viscosity- and temperature-controlled dynamical behaviour of rhodamine dyes in the excited state has been investigated by stationary and time-resolved fluorescence measurements using synchrotron radiation. An efficient deactivation pathway is linked with rotation of the amino groups presumably towards a state with charge localization. It is shown how electronic and steric factors influence the relaxation rate.</abstract>

      <abstract>It is demonstrated that the size of small metal particles can be manipulated with laser light. Even a considerable narrowing of a given size distribution on a surface can be achieved. This becomes possible by a size-selective laser-ablation process. Besides measurements of the ablation rate as a function of illumination time, laser wavelength, laser intensity, and particle size, a model is presented for the variation of the size distribution. Good agreement with experiment is found.</abstract>

      <abstract>We report the first experimental observation of momentum transfer from a surface plasmon to a single dielectric sphere. Using a photonic force microscope, we measure the plasmon radiation forces on different polystyrene beads as a function of their distance from the metal surface. We show that the force magnitude at resonance is strongly enhanced compared to a nonresonant illumination. Measurements performed as a function of the probe particle size indicate that optical manipulation by plasmon fields has a strong potential for optical sorting.</abstract>

      <abstract>The spontaneous emission lifetime and intensity of Er implanted into SiO2 is modified by a Si/SiO2 planar microcavity. The cavity strongly affects the coupling of the optically excited Er3+ to the radiative and waveguiding modes of the system, resulting in a spontaneous lifetime of 14.8 ms for a cavity off-resonance with the Er3+ versus a lifetime of 9.1 ms for an on-resonance cavity. The observed spontaneous emission lifetime changes agree well with calculated values based on a computation method which is also presented.</abstract>

      <abstract>The telecommunications revolution has created a strong motivation to build photonic devices of ever smaller size and higher density. Using photosynthetic structures found in nature as an inspiration, we synthesized artificial structures that act like diffusive waveguides. These waveguides use FRET to transport energy, and we demonstrated the idea with 3- and 5-fluorophore structures which utilize DNA as a scaffold. A quantitative model that explains the results and provides the mechanism behind the energy transfer is also presented.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper describes the use of plasmonics-based nanoprobes that act as molecular sentinels for DNA diagnostics. The plasmonics nanoprobe comprises a metal nanoparticle and a stem-loop DNA molecule tagged with a Raman label. The nanoprobe utilizes the specificity and selectivity of the DNA hairpin probe sequence to detect a specific target DNA sequence of interest. In the absence of target DNA, the stem-loop configuration maintains the Raman label in proximity to the metal nanoparticle, inducing an intense surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect that produces a strong Raman signal upon laser excitation. Upon hybridization of a complementary target DNA sequence to the nanoprobe, the stem-loop configuration is disrupted, causing the Raman label to physically separate from the metal nanoparticle, thus quenching the SERS signal. The usefulness and potential application of the plasmonics nanoprobe for diagnosis is demonstrated using the gag gene sequence of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). We successfully demonstrated the specificity and selectivity of the plasmonics nanoprobes to detect PCR amplicons of the HIV gene. The potential for combining the spectral selectivity and high sensitivity of the SERS process with inherent molecular specificity of DNA hairpins to diagnose molecular target sequences in homogeneous solutions is discussed.</abstract>

      <abstract>Visible-near-IR luminescence spectra of gold MPCs that are similar, irrespective of the number of core atoms (all &lt;2 nm diameter) and different monolayers, are reported. The luminescence can be quantitatively invoked by introducing polar ligands into nonpolar MPC monolayers and by galvanic exchange of metal atoms on the MPC core surface with different metals. The observed emissions are believed to result from surface-localized states that depend on both the core metal of the nanoparticle and the ligands attached to the metal surface.</abstract>

      <abstract>Quenching of the photoluminescence ({PL}) emission from conjugated macromolecules by charge transfer to cationic electron acceptors is studied by changing the ion concentration in buffered aqueous solutions, by changing the concentration of acceptors, and by varying the temperature. {A} weakly bound complex is formed (in water) between polyanionic conjugated macromolecules and cationic electron acceptors with {C}oulomb binding energy  150 me{V}. {T}he mean distance between the polymer(-) and quencher(+) was estimated as 10 {\AA}, consistent with the effective charge-transfer distance. {A}t high quencher concentrations, quenching by acceptors within the sphere-of-action becomes important; a modified {S}tern-{V}olmer equation is used to estimate the radius ( 400 {\AA}). {H}igh-temperature studies of concentrated quencher solutions independently indicate a crossover from static quenching to sphere-of-action quenching with a radius  400 {\AA}. {S}ince the radius is comparable to the radius of gyration of the macromolecule, the high molecular weight of the conjugated polymer enhances the quenching.</abstract>

      <abstract>Gold nanoparticles synthesized by in situ chemical reduction of HAuCl4 with the use of polyelectrolyte serve as reductant and stabilizer. At the same time, gold nanoparticles were observed self-assembly into dimer and trimer aggregates, which were evidenced by TEM. The nucleation and growth kinetics was characterized by in situ UV-vis experiment. A model was proposed to illustrate the formation mechanism. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</abstract>

      <abstract>A significant challenge faced in the use of nanoscale building blocks is developing parallel methods for interconnecting and patterning assemblies of the individual components. {M}olecular or polymeric scaffolds hold promise as a means of preparing closely spaced, specifically arranged nanoscale assemblies. {H}ere we show how a biopolymer, {DNA}, can be used as a scaffold for the assembly of extended, close-packed, ligand-stabilized metal nanoparticle structures, including several desirable architectures (such as lines, ribbons, and branches). {E}lectrostatic binding of ligand-stabilized nanoparticles to the {DNA} backbone results in extended linear chain-like structures, ribbon-like structures composed of parallel nanoparticle chains, and branched structures. {H}igh-resolution transmission electron microscopy shows that the particles are evenly spaced, separated only by the 15 {\AA} imposed by the intervening ligand shell. {T}hese studies demonstrate that biomolecular nanolithography (the arrangement of nanoscale building blocks on biomolecular scaffolds) is a viable approach to interconnecting individual devices into extended, closely spaced assemblies.</abstract>

      <abstract>The high affinity of the noncovalent interaction between biotin and streptavidin forms the basis for many diagnostic assays that require the formation of an irreversible and specific linkage between biological macromolecules. Comparison of the refined crystal structures of apo and a streptavidin:biotin complex shows that the high affinity results from several factors. These factors include the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions between biotin and the protein, together with the ordering of surface polypeptide loops that bury the biotin in the protein interior. Structural alterations at the biotin binding site produce quaternary changes in the streptavidin tetramer. These changes apparently propagate through cooperative deformations in the twisted beta sheets that link tetramer subunits.</abstract>

      <abstract>We report experimental and theoretical studies on the plasmon resonances of finite one-dimensional chains of Au nanoparticles excited by evanescent light waves with polarization parallel to the chains. The experimental results show that the plasmon resonance peak wavelengths of these finite 1D chains are significantly red-shifted in comparison to that of single Au nanoparticle. Contrary to previous findings, the peak wavelengths are observed to be a nonmonotonic function of particle numbers in the chain. This phenomenon is reproduced in the theoretical results obtained by using the transfer-matrix method and is shown to occur only for larger particles where phase retardation effects are important in plasmon coupling.</abstract>

      <abstract>Recent advances in single-molecule detection and single-molecule spectroscopy at room temperature by laser-induced fluorescence offer new tools for the study of individual macromolecules under physiological conditions. These tools relay conformational states, conformational dynamics, and activity of single biological molecules to physical observables, unmasked by ensemble averaging. Distributions and time trajectories of these observables can therefore be measured during a reaction without the impossible need to synchronize all the molecules in the ensemble. The progress in applying these tools to biological studies with the use of fluorophores that are site-specifically attached to macromolecules is reviewed.</abstract>

      <abstract>The enhancements of normal Raman scattering, resonance Raman scattering, and fluorescence from molecules adsorbed on identical, well-characterized, silver-island films are reported. The enhancement arises from the electromagnetic interaction between the molecules and the electronic plasma resonance of the silver islands. A hierarchy of enhancement ratios is found, with typical values of 105 for RS, 103 for RRS and 10?1 to 10 for fluorescence, depending on the quantum yield of the molecular fluorescence. A model, developed on heuristic grounds and substantiated using the density matrix formalism, describes the light scattering processes and the effects of the plasma resonance. This model presents a unified picture of the surface-induced enhancement effects and is consistent with the experimental values. The comparison of all the forms of optical scattering leads to a complete determination of the role of the plasma resonances in the various portions of the scattering process. The excitation of the electronic plasma resonance results in an increased local field at the molecules leading to an increased excitation or absorption rate. Similarly, the excitation of the plasma resonance by the molecular emission dipole results in an increase in the radiative decay rate. However, the electromagnetic coupling of the molecule to the plasma resonance also adds an additional damping channel which can result in a reduction of the absorption or excitation rate as well as the emission yield. The resultant balance of these processes leads to the hierarchy in the measured enhancements. The hierarchy of enhancements is also shown to have important spectroscopic consequences.</abstract>

      <abstract>Measurement of fluorescent lifetimes of dye-tagged DNA molecules reveal the existence of different conformations. Conformational fluctuations observed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy give rise to a relaxation behavior that is described by "stretched" exponentials and indicates the presence of a distribution of transition rates between two conformations. Whether this is an inhomogeneous distribution, where each molecule contributes with its own reaction rate to the overall distribution, or a homogeneous distribution, where the reaction rate of each molecule is time-dependent, is not yet known. We used a tetramethylrhodamine-linked 217-bp DNA oligonucleotide as a probe for conformational fluctuations. Fluorescence fluctuations from single DNA molecules attached to a streptavidin-coated surface directly show the transitions between two conformational states. The conformational fluctuations typical for single molecules are similar to those seen in single ion channels in cell membranes.</abstract>

      <abstract>The feasibility of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) for the monitoring of fast kinetic processes has been investigated. The interaction between Rh6G and different nucleotides in water served as a model system. Following the fluorescence fluctuations arising due to dye-nucleotide interactions around an unperturbed equilibrium it is possible to retrieve information about association and dissociation kinetics of the different electronic states involved in the fluorescence generation. No macroscopic perturbation of thermodynamic parameters, as in chemical relaxation experiments, is needed. Compared to other fluorescence techniques used to study interactions of this kind, such as flash photolysis, FCS requires a very simple instrumentation. A very broad time interval can be covered and the fact that FCS is based on a fluorescence microscope allows for kinetic studies on a microscopic scale. Hence, FCS can be used in parallel or as an alternative to more established fluorescence techniques providing a simple and easy-to-use tool by which similar and complementary information on kinetic processes can be obtained.</abstract>

      <abstract>Cy5 is one of a few commercially available dyes in the near-infrared wavelength range. In this study, the fluorescence fluctuations of Cy5 have been investigated under steady-state excitation conditions by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). The fluctuations in fluorescence are compatible with and can be used to characterize the photoinduced isomerization and back-isomerization, as well as the transitions between the singlet and triplet states of the dye. By employing a simple kinetic model, the rate constants of these processes can be determined. The model was used over a broad range of experimental conditions, where the influence on the isomerization properties of solvent viscosity, polarity, and temperature, excitation intensity and wavelength, and the presence of different side groups was investigated. We propose FCS as a useful and simple complementary approach to study isomerization processes of cyanine dyes yielding information about the rates of both the photoinduced isomerization and the back-isomerization, as well as of the kinetic properties of the triplet states. Our data show that for most excitation conditions relevant for ultrasensitive fluorescence spectroscopy a photostationary equilibrium is established between the isomeric forms, where approximately 50 molecules can be expected to be in their weakly fluorescent cis states. The fluorophores therefore lose about half of their fluorescence capacity. This is of relevance for the performance of the dye in all applications of fluorescence spectroscopy where a high sensitivity or a fast readout is required, such as in single-molecule detection experiments and in many applications of confocal laser scanning microscopy.</abstract>

      <abstract>A review of the subject of near-field optical imaging of metal nanoparticles is presented. The emphasis of the review is on experimental achievements in optical imaging of single metal nanoparticles and nanostructured arrays with metal nanoparticle building blocks. The importance of the measurements as they relate to nano-optical applications and scientific understanding of optical near-fields is highlighted. Advancements in scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) that have enabled near-field images of these structures are also featured, as are theoretical contributions for interpreting SNOM images.</abstract>

      <abstract>We report the observation of coherent polarization coupling between the exciton of a molecular J-aggregate and the electronic polarization of noble metal nanoparticles. For Ag nanoparticles, coherent exciton coupling to the conduction band electrons leads to constructive interference and a long-lived exciton. For Au nanoparticles, the excitonic state interferes destructively with bound electron transition dipoles and the exciton lifetime is reduced by two orders of magnitude. Coherent polarization coupling in heterostructured nanomaterials may strongly impact the functionality of future nanoelectronic and nanooptical materials.</abstract>

      <abstract>Radiationless energy transfer from excited dye molecules to silver islands has been studied. {T}he dye is separated from the metal surface by a thin layer of {S}i{O}x. {W}hen the spacer layer thickness is increased from d=0, an increase in the luminescence intensity is observed. {F}or the low quantum yield dye {B}asic {F}uchsin, a maximum luminescence enhancement of 200 is observed at d{S}i{O}[approximately-equal-to]25 {\AA}, relative to dye on an inert substrate. {W}ith further increase in spacer thickness, the luminescence intensity drops rapidly toward the unenhanced value. {T}he results are interpreted in terms of competition between local field enhancement and loss of excitation by energy transfer to the metal.</abstract>

      <abstract>A recently devised, discrete-dipole approximation (DDA) based method for computing optical forces is used to explore geometry dependent aspects of the light induced interactions between pairs of silver nanoparticles, including the influence of particle shape, relative positioning of the particles, and incident field orientation. The interactions are observed to have a large degree of generic character, independent of the details of the particle shape. The size of the optical forces is also compared to estimates for the van der Waals forces, and the results are used to assess the potential importance of radiation forces on recent experiments demonstrating photoinduced self-assembly of triangular silver nanoprisms.</abstract>

      <abstract>Mie scattering is an important tool for diagnosing microparticles or aerosol particles in technical or natural environments. Mie theory is restricted to spherical, homogeneous, isotropic and non-magnetic particles in a non-absorbing medium. However, as microparticles are hardly ever spherical or homogeneous, there is much interest in more advanced scattering theories. During recent decades, scattering methods for non-spherical and non-homogeneous particles have been developed and even some computer codes are readily available. Extension of Mie theory covers coated spheres, stratified spheres and clustered spheres. For homogeneous non-spherical particles such as spheroids, ellipsoids and finite cylinders, surface discretization methods have been developed. Scattering by inhomogeneous particles may be computed by volume discretization methods.</abstract>

      <abstract>We describe the use of the Taylor dispersion method to determine the diffusion coefficients of monolayer protected clusters (MPCs). The MPCs have nanometer Au cores ( 1-5 nm diameter) coated with a passivating, self-assembled monolayer of thiolate ligands ( 40-600). The results are found to agree with electrochemically measured diffusion coefficients, validating both approaches for measuring nanoparticle diffusivities. Taylor diffusion coefficients are used to calculate MPC hydrodynamic diameters under the sticking and the slip boundary conditions of the Stokes-Einstein equation, which are compared to the overall MPC diameter-estimated as the core diameter (measured by TEM) plus the length (2L) of two fully extended ligands. Better agreement between calculated and experimental hydrodynamic diameters of alkanethiolate-coated MPCs in organic solvents are obtained using slip boundary conditions, implying free draining of solvent through the outer portion of the extended chains. The hard-sphere (sticking) version of the Stokes-Einstein relation predicts unrealistically small hydrodynamic diameters. Similar but less clear-cut results are obtained for tiopronin-coated MPC ions in aqueous media.</abstract>

      <abstract>We examine whether single molecule sensitivity in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) can be explained in the framework of classical electromagnetic theory. The influence of colloid particle shape and size, composition (Ag or Au) and interparticle separation distance on the wavelength-dependent SERS enhancement factor is reported. Our calculations indicate that the maximum enhancement factor achievable through electromagnetics is of the order 1011. This is obtained only under special circumstances, namely at interstitial sites between particles and at locations outside sharp surface protrusions. The comparative rarity of such sites, together with the extreme spatial localization of the enhancement they provide, can qualitatively explain why only very few surface sites seem to contribute to the measured signal in single-molecule SERS experiments. Enhancement factors of the order 1014-1015, which have been reported in recent experiments, are likely to involve additional enhancement mechanisms such as chemisorption induced resonance Raman effects.</abstract>

      <abstract>e demonstrate the detection of molecular vibrations in single hemoglobin (Hb) protein molecules attached to isolated and immobilized silver nanoparticles by surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). A comparison between calculation and experiment indicates that electromagnetic field effects dominate the surface enhancement, and that single molecule Hb SERS is possible only for molecules situated between Ag particles. The vibrational spectra exhibit temporal fluctuations of unknown origin which appear to be characteristic of the single molecule detection limit.</abstract>

      <abstract>We use extended Mie theory to investigate optical forces induced by and acting on small silver nanoparticle aggregates excited at surface plasmon resonance. It is shown that single molecules can be trapped at junctions between closely spaced nanoparticles, which are simultaneously pulled together by optical forces. These effects could significantly influence surface-enhanced Raman scattering and related spectroscopies under normal experimental conditions and contribute to single-molecule sensitivity.</abstract>

      <abstract>It is well known that surface plasmon absorption (color) of Au nanoparticles highly depends on its size, shape, and surrounding surface environment, providing a great opportunity for the development of Au nanoparticles as a probe for chemical and biochemical sensing and as a building block for nano-optical devices. Currently, it remains incompletely understood how the surface properties of Au nanoparticles ultimately define its optical properties, hindering the progress of rational design of Au nanoparticles for biochemical sensing and assembly of nano-optical devices. Ru(bpy)32+ possesses rich photochemical and electrochemical properties, offering a unique probe to study the surface environment of Au nanoparticles. In this study, we investigate the kinetics of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles (6.5, 19, 48, 97 nm) in the presence of Ru(bpy)32+ at 24.0, 33.0, and 51.0 C. We find that the color-change rate of Au nanoparticles is highly sensitive to the amount of Ru(bpy)32+. In addition, the minimum (critical) concentration of Ru(bpy)32+ needed to change the color of Au nanoparticles is highly dependent upon temperature and nanoparticle size. TEM images illustrate that the color-change mechanism of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+ highly depends on the size of nanoparticles. Control experiments using NaCl and MgCl2 to replace Ru(bpy)32+ show no color change, suggesting that the color change of Au nanoparticles induced by Ru(bpy)32+ is not solely attributable to the salt effect. Other factors, such as adsorption of Ru(bpy)32+ on the Au nanoparticle surface, may be involved. Moreover, in the presence of the critical concentration of Ru(bpy)32+, as temperature increases from 24.0 C to 51.0 C, the color-change rate of 19 nm Au nanoparticles increases 8-fold, whereas the color-change rate of 48 nm Au nanoparticles decreases 3-fold, showing the temperature dependence of surface plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles in the presence of surface adsorbates, Ru(bpy)32+.</abstract>

      <abstract>In electromagnetic multisphere-scattering calculations the reexpansion method for seeking a single-field representation of the total scattered field is found impracticable because of severe numerical problems. We present a simple single-field expansion of the total scattered far field based on an asymptotic form of vector translational addition theorems. With this asymptotic expansion of the far field, we derive analytical expressions for the scattering properties of an arbitrary aggregate of spheres. Resulting formulas are free from numerical problems in practical applications. Theoretical predictions from this far-field solution for various aggregates of spheres that we tested agree favorably with laboratory microwave scattering measurements. Some numerical results are presented and compared with experimental data.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present a comprehensive solution to the classical problem of electromagnetic scattering by aggregates of an arbitrary number of arbitrarily configured spheres that are isotropic and homogeneous but may be of different size and composition. The profile of incident electromagnetic waves is arbitrary. The analysis is based on the framework of the Mie theory for a single sphere and the existing addition theorems for spherical vector wave functions. The classic Mie theory is generalized. Applying the extended Mie theory to all the spherical constituents in an aggregate simultaneously leads to a set of coupled linear equations in the unknown interactive coefficients. We propose an asymptotic iteration technique to solve for these coefficients. The total scattered field of the entire ensemble is constructed with the interactive scattering coefficients by the use of the translational addition theorem a second time. Rigorous analytical expressions are derived for the cross sections in a general case and for all the elements of the amplitude-scattering matrix in a special case of a plane-incident wave propagating along the z axis. As an illustration, we present some of our preliminary numerical results and compare them with previously published laboratory scattering measurements.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present the comparison of light-scattering calculations between a rigorous solution and the discrete-dipole approximation (DDA) for two-sphere aggregates. We also compare theoretical predictions with laboratory scattering measurements to examine the validity of the numerical solutions. It is found that there are cases in which the DDA solution, while satisfying the validity criterion for interdipole spacing to be small compared with the wavelength of incident radiation, deviates significantly from the rigorous solution and the experimental results. We show that the DDA works reasonably well for small-volume structures and that its validity is challenged, at least as it is currently implemented, when used on larger structures. We also show that, besides its advantages in reliability, the rigorous solution approach is far superior to the approximation method in computing efficiency as well.</abstract>

      <abstract>A number of polynuclear d10 transition metal complexes have been found to exhibit interesting luminescence properties. The photoluminescence properties of polynuclear d10 metal complexes are highly diversified. In the presence of a wide range of bridging and ancillary ligands, the excited states of such complexes have been suggested to range from metal-to-ligand charge-transfer, ligand-to-metal charge-transfer, metal-centred to ligand-centred in nature. Recent work on the photophysical and photochemical properties, as well as the applications of this class of luminescent polynuclear d10 metal complexes will be described in this review article.</abstract>

      <abstract>Stable undecagold clusters were synthesized and protected with a monolayer of alkanethiolates. The particles were found to exhibit semiconductor electronic characteristics with a band gap of about 1.8 eV, as evaluated from voltammetric and spectroscopic measurements. Photoluminescence in the visible range was also observed from the peak position at 840 nm. The indirect band-gap characteristics indicate that there exist substantial surface trap states in the nanoparticle molecules. Prior to exchange reactions with alkanethiols, however, no luminescence was observed with the gold particles, Au11Cl3(PPh3)7. This was interpreted, at least in part, by the effect of ligand fields on the electronic (band-gap) energy splitting and the resulting electron distributions. These observations strongly suggest that surface chemistry plays a vital role in determining the electronic energy structure of these subnanometer-sized gold particles.</abstract>

      <abstract>We have developed a new detection technology that uses resonance light scattering (RLS) particles as labels for analyte detection in a wide range of formats including immuno and DNA probe type of assays in solution, solid phase, cells, and tissues. When a suspension of nano sized gold or silver particles is illuminated with a fine beam of white light, the scattered light has a clear (not cloudy) color that depends on composition and particle size. This scattered light can be used as the signal for ultrasensitive analyte detection. The advantages of gold particles as detection labels are that (a) their light producing power is equivalent to more than 500,000 fluorescein molecules, (b) they can be detected at concentrations as low as 10-15 M in suspension by eye and a simple illuminator, (c) they do not photobleach, (d) individual particles can be seen in a simple student microscope with dark field illumination, (e) color of scattered light can be changed by changing particle size or composition for multicolor multiplexing, and (f) they can be conjugated with antibodies, DNA probes, ligands, and protein receptors for specific analyte detection. These advantages allow for ultra-senstive analyte detection with easiness of use and simple and relatively inexpensive instrumentation. We have shown that our RLS technology can indeed be used for ultra-sensitive detection in a wide range of applications including immuno and DNA probe assays in solution and solid phases, detection of cell surface components and in situ hybridization in cells and tissues. Most of the assay formats described in this article can be adapted for drug fast throughput screening.</abstract>

      <abstract>Enhanced spontaneous emission has been observed with wavelength-sized monolithic Fabry-Perot cavities containing GaAs quantum wells. With an on-resonance cavity structure, the photoluminescence intensity increases in the cavity axis direction, and the spontaneous emission lifetime is experimentally found to decrease.</abstract>

      <abstract>As optical trapping by a focused laser beam is applied for nanoparticles, multiple particles are grasped in the focal spot and make an assembly. Gold nanoparticles confined in such a submicrometer optical cage show a characteristic extinction spectrum depending on laser power. The spectral change can be induced reversibly and repeatedly by tuning the laser power, demonstrating that the assembly of gold nanoparticles can be controlled by the gradient force. This is attributed to the soft confinement of nanoparticles dressed in electrostatic potential barriers.</abstract>

      <abstract>The extinction coefficient per mole of nanocrystals at the first exitonic absorption peak, epsilon, for high-quality CdTe, CdSe, and CdS nanocrystals was found to be strongly dependent on the size of the nanocrystals, between a square and a cubic dependence. The measurements were carried out using either nanocrystals purified with monitored purification procedures or nanocrystals prepared through controlled etching methods. The nature of the surface ligands, the refractive index of the solvents, the PL quantum yield of the nanocrystals, the methods used for the synthesis of the nanocrystals, and the temperature for the measurements all did not show detectable influence on the extinction coefficient for a given sized nanocrystal within experimental error.</abstract>

      <abstract>Optical-based distance measurements are essential for tracking biomolecular conformational changes, drug discovery, and cell biology. {T}raditional {F}örster resonance energy transfer ({FRET}) is efficient for separation distances up to 100 {\AA}. {W}e report the first successful application of a dipole-surface type energy transfer from a molecular dipole to a nanometal surface that more than doubles the traditional {F}örster range (220 {\AA}) and follows a 1/{R}4 distance dependence. {W}e appended a 1.4 nm {A}u cluster to the 5' end of one {DNA} strand as the energy acceptor and a fluorescein ({FAM}) to the 5' end of the complementary strand as the energy donor. {A}nalysis of the energy transfer on {DNA} lengths (15, 20, 30, 60bp), complemented by protein-induced {DNA} bending, provides the basis for fully mapping the extent of this dipole surface type mechanism over its entire usable range (50-250 {\AA}). {F}urther, protein function is fully compatible with these nanometal-{DNA} constructs. {S}ignificantly extending the range of optical based methods in molecular rulers is an important leap forward for biophysics.</abstract>

      <abstract>Colloidal nanocrystal/DNA conjugates hold the promise of becoming powerful probes for biological diagnostics as well as versatile building blocks for nanotechnology. To fully realize this potential, it is important to precisely control the number of oligonucleotides bound to the nanocrystal. Here we demonstrate electrophoretic isolation of 5 and 10 nm gold nanocrystals bearing discrete numbers of single-stranded DNA (1-5). The potential use of these discrete conjugates in the fabrication of novel nanostructures is discussed.</abstract>

      <abstract>Discrete Au nanoparticle/DNA conjugates have been isolated by electrophoresis and used to form small groupings of particles, such as dimers and trimers. The use of purified conjugates leads to a higher yield of the target structure, and it has allowed us better control and understanding of the system. Newly accessible questions, such as the electrophoretic mobility of nanoparticle/DNA hybrids and the critical role of particle surface charge on mobility, have been studied. Detailed characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has now been done because of the higher quality of the samples. A computer program to generate pair distribution functions from TEM images was developed, pointing out the dependence of interparticle distance with DNA length on dimers of particles.</abstract>

      <abstract>We prepared silver particle dimers with single Cy5 molecules localized between coupled metal particles. The silver particles with a 20 nm diameter were chemically bound with single-stranded oligonucleotides. The dimers were formed by hybridization with double-length single-stranded oligonucleotides that contained single Cy5 molecules. The image analysis revealed that the single-molecule fluorescence was enhanced 7-fold on the metal monomer and 13-fold on the metal dimer relative to the free Cy5-labeled oligonucleotide in the absence of metal. The lifetimes were shortened on the silver monomers and further shortened on the silver dimers, demonstrating the near-field interaction mechanism of fluorophore with the metal substrate. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations were employed to study the distribution of electric field near the metal monomer and dimer. The coupling effect of metal particle on the fluorescence enhancement was discussed.</abstract>

      <abstract>N-(2-Mercaptopropionyl)glycine (tiopronin)-coated silver nanoparticles (average diameter of metal core = 5 nm) were prepared by a modified Brust method. Tiopronin ligands were partially displaced by thiolate single-stranded oligonucleotides via ligand exchange. These particles were immobilized onto a solid substrate through hybridization with target oligonucleotides in a layer-by-layer approach. The dye-labeled complementary oligonucleotides were bound to the particle layers through hybridization. Fluorescence intensity was enhanced with a simultaneous increase of plasmon absorbance from accumulated particles. A steady state was shown at the 10th particle layer and then the fluorescence enhancement showed a plateau. This result reveals that increasing the particle layer contributes to fluorescence enhancement. This novel method was used to detect DNA hybridization through both absorbance and emission spectral changes.</abstract>

      <abstract>Tiopronin monolayer-protected silver nanoparticles with different core sizes (average diameter = 2, 5, 20 nm) were prepared by using different mole ratios of silver nitrate/tiopronin. Ligands on the silver particles were partially displaced by fluorescein-labeled thiolate single-stranded oligonucleotides or their complementary unlabeled oligonucleotides through ligand exchange. The fluorophores on silver particles showed a surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF) dependent on the size of metallic cores. The particles could be coupled through hybridizations of oligonucleotides bound on the particles. The coupled particles were aggregated due to multiple displacements of oligonucleotides on each particle, resulting in stronger SEF. The dye-labeled oligonucleotides were assembled on the silver islands on the solid substrate, and the complementary oligonucleotide-displaced particles were coupled via oligonucleotide hybridization. The couplings between particles and islands resulted in an obvious fluorescence enhancement.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this work we present a detailed time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) investigation of the absorption and Raman spectra of a pyrazine molecule located at the junction between two Ag20 clusters. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering enhancements of the order of $10^6$ have been found for the junction system, which are similar to enhancements of $10^5$ found for individual silver nanoparticles. Surprisingly, the chemical enhancement is found to account for as much as $10^5$, suggesting that this mechanism might be more important than previously believed, in particular for nanoparticle aggregates. Moreover, TDDFT calculations suggest that unlike larger nanoparticles, the junction between small Ag20 tetrahedral clusters does not provide an electromagnetic "hot spot".</abstract>

      <abstract>Highly fluorescent, water-soluble, few-atom Au quantum dots have been created that behave as multielectron artificial atoms with discrete, size-tunable electronic transitions throughout the visible and near IR. Correlation of nanodot sizes with emission energies fits the simple relation, E-Fermi/N-1/3, predicted by the jellium model. Providing the "missing link" between atomic and nanoparticle behavior in noble metals, these emissive, water-soluble Au nanoclusters open new opportunities for biological labels, energy transfer pairs, and light emitting sources in nanoscale optoelectronics.</abstract>

      <abstract>Gold colloidal containing rare earth ions Dy3+ were prepared at room temperature. Fluorescence spectra of Dy3+ ions and Au colloid containing Dy3+ were measured. For solution containing Dy3+, fluorescence emission occurs at visible light wavelength region. Two emission peaks are observed at 480 nm and 570 nm respectively when the corresponding excitation wavelength is at 350 nm. When An colloids were added to the solution containing Dy3+, both these two fluorescence peaks were enhanced. Furthermore, with the increasing Au content, the fluorescence increases first and then decreases. We believe that this increased fluorescence are due to the local field enhancement around Dy3+ ions owing to the induced higher orders of surface plasmon resonance. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

      <abstract>Surface modification of citrate-reduced gold nanoparticles with 2-mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA) was carried out in the aqueous phase. This provides a way to obtain carboxylic acid functionalized gold nanoparticles with diameter above 10 nm. The influence of the protecting MSA layer on the behavior of the modified gold nanoparticles in comparison with that of the traditional citrate-reduced gold colloid was evaluated by HCl titration, cyanide etching, and seeded growth tests. The modified gold nanoparticles show an improved stability against pH changes and cyanide etching. They do show further growth, which appears to be more homogeneous than for the unmodified particles.</abstract>

      <abstract>We have measured the temperature driven denaturing, or melting transition in poly d(A)-poly d(T) DNA oligomers of various lengths in different buffer conditions. Our findings are in clear disagreement with two state, reaction kinetics model, and we find that the so-called zipper model, where denaturing proceeds through opening of the duplex at the ends describes well the temperature dependence of the average number of open base pairs. Analysis of the length dependence of the transition parameters however suggest that bubble formation is important and that the transition, in the thermodynamic limit, is continuous, albeit close to first order.</abstract>

      <title>Training Manual on Gracilaria Culture and Seaweed Processing in China</title>
      <organization>FAO - Fisheries and Aquaculture Department</organization>
      <year>1990</year>
      <abstract>Gracilaria is a group of warm water seaweeds. There are more than one hundred species in the world, some of which have very important economic value. Gracilaria is used as food and in the preparation of food products. It is also an important raw material in agar-agar production. At present, the world's annual output of Gracilaria is about 30,000 tons, dry weight, most of which comes from natural production. For example, the natural production in Chile, Argentina, and Brazil accounts for one third of this total output. With the increasing demand for Gracilaria, greater attention has been focused on the development of its artificial culture by many countries, especially those in Southeast Asia. China is the earliest country that artificially cultured Gracilaria. Today, the culture area in South China is about 2,000 ha producing 3,000 tons dried material annually. Taiwan produces 1,000 tons dried Gracilaria yearly from 400 hectares under cultivation. Nowadays, Gracilaria is cultured mainly using the following methods: bottom culture, raft culture, stake-rope culture and pond culture. Pond culture can be divided into two systems, monoculture and polyculture with shrimp and other species. The varieties of culture methods can be adapted for different areas. In view of the importance of Gracilaria as a seafarming commodity, the National Coordinators of the Regional Seafarming Project recommended the dissemination of its culture and processing technology, through a regional training and demonstration activity, as a means to further increase the opportunities to develop the seafarming industry of the region.</abstract>
