  abstract = {A gel-diffusion technique in which transport occurs across a thin
    agar membrane has been devised. This technique was used for pore-size
    calibration of a series of agar gels of various concentrations by
    measurement of hindrance to diffusion of human hemoglobin and southern
    bean mosaic virus particles. Pore radii calculated from independent
    restricted diffusion measurements of these two particle-species by
    use of a theoretical equation of were in very good agreement, and
    show that this equation provides a close approximation to the diffusional
    restriction occurring in these systems. Values of restricted diffusion
    coefficients in gels of various pore sizes were obtained from restricted
    diffusion measurements of four other proteins (rabbit [gamma]-globulin,
    human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, and pancreatic ribonuclease).
    When these coefficients were extrapolated to conditions of infinite
    pore size (zero gel concentration) the values obtained agreed generally
    with reported values of the free diffusion coefficients for these
    proteins. Sharp differentiation in diffusional restriction on the
    basis of particle size and shape was demonstrated.}

    surface modification procedure. {F}irst, a carboxyl-terminated alkanethiol
    was chemisorbed onto the surface of gold nanoparticles in the presence
    of a stabilizing agent. {S}ubsequently, the carboxyl groups were
    reacted with (+)-biotinyl-3,6,9,-trioxaundecanediamine and 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol.
    {T}his procedure resulted in stable, ligand-modified gold nanoparticles.
    {U}pon interaction with streptavidin, the biotinylated gold nanoparticles
    aggregated by means of specific biomolecular recognition. {T}heir
    aggregation was studied by optical absorption spectroscopy. {C}ontrolled
    aggregation of biotinylated gold nanoparticles resulted in a shift
    in the surface plasmon resonance peak and broadening of the absorption
    spectrum of the nanoparticles. {T}he spectral changes were used to
    assess the extent of aggregation. {A}ggregation was found to be dependent
    on the concentrations of streptavidin, biotinylated gold nanoparticles,
    and the surface mole fraction of biotin groups on the nanoparticles.
    {M}aximum aggregation was observed when 24 n{M} streptavidin and
    0.80 n{M} biotinylated gold nanoparticles were used. {R}eversal of
    nanoparticle aggregation was accomplished by the addition of soluble
    biotin to the streptavidin-nanoparticle aggregates. {K}inetic analysis
    of the absorbance data showed that streptavidin-induced aggregation
    of biotinylated gold nanoparticles could be interpreted in terms
    of a {R}eaction-{L}imited {C}olloidal {A}ggregation ({RLCA}) model.

    of the signal is found to be independent of the fluctuations, to
    vary from one spot to the next, and to be highly dependent on the
    direction of the incident electric field. The "SERS continuum" dominates
    the signal and is assumed to arise from electronic Raman processes
    in the metal that are triggered by chemisorption of the molecule
    in the hot spot. The source of the Raman signal is therefore highly
    localized around the hot spot. The local structure determines the
    depolarization properties and is often extremely anisotropic. Conversely,
    the Rayleigh scattering does not depend on the molecule or the hot
    spot and is delocalized over the whole aggregate, which is always
    found to be highly isotropic. The Rayleigh scattering therefore does
    not fluctuate and is always highly polarized.}

    For each of three different dyes, we observe a strong correlation

    overlap with the plasmon resonance of the nanoparticle. On average,
    we observe the brightest fluorescence from dyes attached to metal
    nanoparticles that have a LSPR scattering peak ~40-120 meV higher
    in energy than the emission peak of the fluorophore. These results

    quantitating the EC50 binding parameters of these mutants to biotin

    W79F and W108F mutants displayed only a 2- to 3-fold increase in
    EC50 for 2-iminobiotin, corresponding to an estimated {Delta}Ka <10,
    while the W120F mutant displayed a much greater alteration in 2-iminobiotin
    EC50, corresponding to an estimated {Delta}Ka of 102. These {Delta}Ka
    values are likely to reflect similar changes for biotin. The 2-iminobiotin
    EC50 values for the Ala mutants fell outside the accessible concentration
    range of the ELISA assay, demonstrating that these mutations lowered
    the Ka by a factor of 104 to 106. Direct estimation of biotin Ka
    values for W79A, W120A, and W120F in an ultrafiltration binding assay
    yielded Ka values of 4.3 x 107 M-1, 8.6 x 106 M-1, and >5 x 109 M-1,
    respectively, in excellent agreement with the ELISA estimates of
    {Delta}Ka with 2-iminobiotin as a reporter ligand. The results of

    type of center (sensitizer, or absorber) and upon the subsequent
    radiationless transfer of energy from the sensitizer to the activator.
    The resonance theory of Förster, which involves only allowed transitions,
    is extended to include transfer by means of forbidden transitions
    which, it is concluded, are responsible for the transfer in all inorganic
    systems yet investigated. The transfer mechanisms of importance are,
    in order of decreasing strength, the overlapping of the electric
    dipole fields of the sensitizer and the activator, the overlapping
    of the dipole field of the sensitizer with the quadrupole field of
    the activator, and exchange effects. These mechanisms will give rise
    to ``sensitization'' of about 10^3-10^4, 10^2, and 30 lattice sites
    surrounding each sensitizer in typical systems. The dependence of
    transfer efficiency upon sensitizer and activator concentrations

  abstract = {Recent research in several groups has identified a new class of metal
    colloidal nanoparticles that is able to enhance the efficiencies
    of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) by as much as 1014-1015
    fold. This enormous enhancement allows single-molecule detection
    and spectroscopy at room temperature. Previous single-molecule and
    single-particle studies have yielded important insights into the
    mechanism of electromagnetic field enhancement, but little is known
    about the contributions of surface active sites and chemical enhancement.
    Here we report a direct examination of chemical enhancement by using
    an integrated flow injection and ultrasensitive optical imaging/spectroscopy
    system. A key feature is that colloidal silver nanoparticles are
    immobilized on a glass surface inside a microflow device and that
    single-particle SERS signals are observed in real time while the
    immobilized particles are treated by chemical reagents in the flow
    cell. In situ surface plasmon scattering studies of spatially isolated
    particles indicate that their electromagnetic properties do not change
    after chemical treatment. Thus, the observed SERS spectral changes
    should primarily come from chemical enhancement at surface active
    sites. Our experimental data reveal that three halide ions (Cl-,
    Br-, and I-) have a substantial activating effect, whereas other
    ions such as citrate, sulfate, and fluoride have little or no effect
    on single-particle SERS. A "quenching" effect is observed for thiosulfate
    ions, which completely destroys the SERS activity. The chemical enhancement
    factors are estimated to be about 102-103 for rhodamine 6G molecules
    adsorbed on single Ag nanoparticles},

    As far as avidin and the avidin-biotin complex are concerned, the
    excitation in NIR did not change the main features of the spectra
    compared with those previously obtained by visible excitation. However,
    the intensity of Trp bands did not change due to the formation of
    the complex when excited by NIR excitation, whereas an intensity
    increase was observed by 514 nm excitation. The percentages of secondary
    structure of the two proteins and the biotin complexes were obtained
    from the Raman spectra. The vibrational results indicate that as
    a consequence of the interaction with biotin, the percentages of
    &bgr;-sheet conformation of the proteins decrease whereas the percentages
    of &agr;-helix conformation increase. The observed changes of the
    conformation of streptavidin induced by biotin interaction are comparable
    with those obtained with avidin; this fact confirms that the type
    of the binding should be similar for the two molecules. Moreover,
    as a result of the biotin binding, the hydrophobicity of the environment
    of the Trp residues of streptavidin slightly increases according
    to the increase in intensity of the 1360 cm-1 component. This result

    we recorded the rotational motions in real time of an erythrosin-bovine

    phosphorescence depolarization techniques. These measurements are
    consistent with the absence of independent motions of large protein

    of milliseconds, and give a single rotational correlation time [phi](BSA,
    1 cP, 20{degrees}C) = 40 {+/-} 2 ns. In addition, we report a detailed
    analysis of the protein hydrodynamics based on two bead-modeling
    methods. In the first, BSA was modeled as a triangular prismatic
    shell with optimized dimensions of 84 x 84 x 84 x 31.5 A, whereas
    in the second, the atomic-level structure of HSA obtained from crystallographic
    data was used to build a much more refined rough-shell model. In

  abstract = {Previous thermodynamic and computational studies have pointed to the
    important energetic role of aromatic contacts in generating the exceptional
    binding free energy of streptavidin-biotin association. We report
    here the crystallographic characterization of single site tryptophan
    mutants in investigating structural consequences of alterations in
    these aromatic contacts. Four tryptophan residues, Trp79, Trp92,
    Trp108 and Trp120, play an important role in the hydrophobic binding
    contributions, which along with a hydrogen bonding network and a
    flexible binding loop give rise to tight ligand binding (Ka~1013M-1).
    The crystal structures of ligand-free and biotin-bound mutants, W79F,
    W108F, W120F and W120A, in the resolution range from 1.9 to 2.3 A
    were determined. Nine data sets for these four different mutants
    were collected, and structural models were refined to R-values ranging
    from 0.15 to 0.20. The major question addressed here is how these
    mutations influence the streptavidin binding site and in particular
    how they affect the binding mode of biotin in the complex. The overall
    folding of streptavidin was not significantly altered in any of the
    tryptophan mutants. With one exception, only minor deviations in
    the unbound structures were observed. In one crystal form of unbound
    W79F, there is a coupled shift in the side-chains of Phe29 and Tyr43
    toward the mutation site, although in a different crystal form these
    shifts are not observed. In the bound structures, the orientation
    of biotin in the binding pocket was not significantly altered in
    the mutant complex. Compared with the wild-type streptavidin-biotin
    complex, there were no additional crystallographic water molecules
    observed for any of the mutants in the binding pocket. These structural
    studies thus suggest that the thermodynamic alterations can be attributed
    to the local alterations in binding residue composition, rather than
    a rearrangement of binding site architectures.}

  abstract = {The streptavidin-biotin complex provides the basis for many important
    biotechnological applications and is an interesting model system
    for studying high-affinity protein-ligand interactions. We report
    here crystallographic studies elucidating the conformation of the
    flexible binding loop of streptavidin (residues 45 to 52) in the
    unbound and bound forms. The crystal structures of unbound streptavidin
    have been determined in two monoclinic crystal forms. The binding
    loop generally adopts an open conformation in the unbound species.
    In one subunit of one crystal form, the flexible loop adopts the
    closed conformation and an analysis of packing interactions suggests
    that protein-protein contacts stabilize the closed loop conformation.
    In the other crystal form all loops adopt an open conformation. Co-crystallization
    of streptavidin and biotin resulted in two additional, different
    crystal forms, with ligand bound in all four binding sites of the
    first crystal form and biotin bound in only two subunits in a second.
    The major change associated with binding of biotin is the closure
    of the surface loop incorporating residues 45 to 52. Residues 49
    to 52 display a 3(10) helical conformation in unbound subunits of
    our structures as opposed to the disordered loops observed in other
    structure determinations of streptavidin. In addition, the open conformation
    is stabilized by a {beta}-sheet hydrogen bond between residues 45
    and 52, which cannot occur in the closed conformation. The 3(10)
    helix is observed in nearly all unbound subunits of both the co-crystallized
    and ligand-free structures. An analysis of the temperature factors
    of the binding loop regions suggests that the mobility of the closed
    loops in the complexed structures is lower than in the open loops
    of the ligand-free structures. The two biotin bound subunits in the
    tetramer found in the MONO b1 crystal form are those that contribute
    Trp 120 across their respective binding pockets, suggesting a structural
    link between these binding sites in the tetramer. However, there
    are no obvious signatures of binding site communication observed
    upon ligand binding, such as quaternary structure changes or shifts
    in the region of Trp 120. These studies demonstrate that while crystallographic
    packing interactions can stabilize both the open and closed forms
    of the flexible loop, in their absence the loop is open in the unbound
    state and closed in the presence of biotin. If present in solution,
    the helical structure in the open loop conformation could moderate
    the entropic penalty associated with biotin binding by contributing
    an order-to-disorder component to the loop closure.}

    {S}urface-enhanced {R}aman scattering is the most prominent example,

    of excited molecular states, absorption, resonance {R}aman and fluorescence
    cross-sections, light scattering and emission yields, energy transfer
    between adsorbed molecules and photochemical processes. {T}he electromagnetic
    theory of these phenomena incorporates the surface effect on the
    local electromagnetic field intensity with the surface-induced radiative
    and nonradiative decay rates to give working expressions for cross-sections,
    rates and yields of surface optical processes in terms of the incident
    beam direction, polarization and frequency, geometry and optical
    properties of the substrate and its environment and of the optical
    properties, location and orientation (relative to the substrate)

    waves. The importance of such waves was ignored for a long time in
    optical and surface physics until the emergence of scanning near-field
    optical microscopes. Taking evanescent waves into account prevents
    the use of any simple approximation in the set of Maxwell's equations.
    The various theoretical approaches of near-field optics are discussed
    from the point of view of their ability to assess evanescent electromagnetic
    waves. We discuss the main results of the application of the various
    practical schemes which all rely on a numerical procedure. This review

    (Caswell et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003, 125, 13914). In that report,
    the specific binding of biotin disulfide to the gold nanorod edges
    was achieved due to the preferred binding of thiol molecules to the
    Au{111} surface (gold nanorod ends) as opposed to the gold nanorod
    side faces. This led to the end-end linkage of gold nanorods upon
    subsequent addition of streptavidin. In this report we demonstrate
    a simple procedure to biotinylate the entire gold nanorod surface
    and subsequently form a 3-D assembly by addition of streptavidin.
    Gold nanorods were synthesized by the three-step seeding protocol
    documented in our previous articles. The surface of gold nanorods
    was further modified by a layer of a weak polyelectrolyte, poly(acrylic
    acid), PAA. A biotin molecule which has an amine group at one end
    (biotin-PEO-amine) was anchored to the carboxylic acid group of the
    polyelectrolyte using the well-known carbodiimide chemistry. This
    process biotinylates the entire gold nanorod surface. Addition of
    streptavidin further leads to aggregation of gold nanorods. A closer
    look at the aggregates reveals a preferential side-to-side assembly
    of gold nanorods. The gold nanorods were characterized at each stage
    by UV-vis spectroscopy, light scattering, and transmission electron
    microscopy (TEM) measurements.}

    is a result of energy transfer from semiconductor to metal nanoparticles.
    The emission intensity and energy transfer rate depend strongly on
    the geometrical parameters of the superstructure and the physical
    and material properties of the nanoparticles. In particular, the
    emission enhancement effect appears for nanoparticles with relatively
    small quantum yield, and silver nanoparticles have stronger enhancement
    compared to gold ones. Using realistic models, we review and analyze
    available experimental data on energy transfer between nanoparticles.
    In hybrid superstructures conjugated with polymer linkers, optical
    emission is sensitive to environmental parameters such as, for example,
    temperature. This sensitivity comes from expansion or contraction
    of a linker. With increasing temperature, emission of polymer-conjugated
    complexes can decrease or increase depending on the organization

    in Amide I region is the band at 1654 cm-1, which is usually attributed
    to a-helical structure. Other bands in Amide I region are attributed
    to various type of turns. Hydration of protein, as well as the solvation
    of protein in phosphate buffer, induces the radical change in the
    secondary structure, especially in the population of a-helices. Drying
    of the protein film causes a partial denaturation. Classical methods
    for determine the changes in secondary structure are not accurate
    enough. Moreover, the interpretation of changes can be easily misleading.

    of hydration and solvation on the protein secondary structure. The

    conditions are used but take into account the possible existence
    of plasmons in the spheres. High-order multipolar (electric and magnetic)
    interaction effects are included. The problem is cast into the calculation
    of the microscopic effective dielectric and magnetic susceptibility
    for the spheres, and that of the appropriate interaction terms. The
    latter (which constitute the hardest part of the theory in general)
    are calculated by formulating in a very practical way a recurrence
    relation for spherical vector wave functions in different reference
    frames. The extinction cross section is derived for any arbitrary
    case in order to allow for comparison of experimental data and previous
    theoretical work. The theory in the absence of any high-order polar
    effect is applied to the case of metallic clusters, e.g., small sodium
    spheres. Effects due to size distribution, sphere separation, and
    sphere magnetic permittivity are analyzed. Different light incidences
    are considered. A very brief discussion of the experimental status
    is presented for the case of metallic spheres. New experiments are
    suggested for which the theory is easily read out. Appendices contain
    new relations between Legendre functions and "spherical coupling
    parameters" allowing one to treat up to (24,24) polar-order interactions.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional crystal structure of the biotin-binding core of
    streptavidin has been determined at 3.1- angstrom resolution. The
    structure was analyzed from diffraction data measured at three wavelengths
    from a single crystal of the selenobiotinyl complex with streptavidin.
    Streptavidin is a tetramer with subunits arrayed in D2 symmetry.
    Each protomer is an 8-stranded {beta} -barrel with simple up-down
    topology. Biotin molecules are bound at one end of each barrel. This
    study demonstrates the effectiveness of multiwavelength anomalous
    diffraction (MAD) procedures for macromolecular crystallography and
    provides a basis for detailed study of biotinavidin interactions.}

    could result in thermal effects with a spatial confinement of less

    controlled intracellular effects.


     Conjugates of colloidal gold and alkaline phosphatase (aP) are presented
    as a model system for investigating protein inactivation in the vicinity
    of strongly absorbing nanoparticles. aP was coupled either directly
    or via antibodies to 15 nm gold particles. These conjugates were
    irradiated with picosecond pulses emitted by a frequency doubled
    Nd:YLF laser. Denaturation was detected as a loss of protein function
    with the help of a fluorescence assay.


     Irradiation with 104 pulses resulted in the inactivation of aP at
    an irradiance of 50 mJ/cm2 per pulse when the protein was coupled
    directly to the particles. With similar irradiation parameters a
    significant inactivation of aP which was coupled not directly but
    via two antibodies to the gold, was not observed. This shows that
    inactivating proteins with nanoabsorbers under irradiation with picosecond
    laser pulses is possible with a high spatial confinement.


     However, from these experiments it is difficult to determine whether
    the aP was destroyed thermally or whether it was inactivated by a
    photochemical reaction. Therefore, further experiments are needed
    to elucidate the damage mechanisms.},

  abstract = {It has been recently shown that the strength of plasmon coupling between
    a pair of plasmonic metal nanoparticles falls as a function of the
    interparticle gap scaled by the particle size with a near-exponential
    decay trend that is universally independent of nanoparticle size,
    shape, metal type, or medium dielectric constant. In this letter,
    we extend this universal scaling behavior to the dielectric core-metal
    shell nanostructure. By using extended Mie theory simulations of
    silica core-metal nanoshells, we show that when the shift of the
    nanoshell plasmon resonance wavelength scaled by the solid nanosphere
    resonance wavelength is plotted against the shell thickness scaled
    by the core radius, nanoshells with different dimensions (radii)
    exhibit the same near-exponential decay. Thus, the nanoshell system
    becomes physically analogous to the particle-pair system, i.e., the
    nanoshell plasmon resonance results from the coupling of the inner
    shell surface (cavity) and the outer shell surface (sphere) plasmons
    over a separation distance essentially given by the metal shell thickness,
    which is consistent with the plasmon hybridization model of Prodan,
    Halas, and Nordlander. By using the universal scaling behavior in
    the nanoshell system, we propose a simple expression for predicting
    the dipolar plasmon resonance of a silica-gold nanoshell of given

    gold (Au) nanodisc pairs are investigated using microabsorption spectroscopy

    we find that the fractional plasmon wavelength shift for polarization
    along the interparticle axis decays nearly exponentially with the
    interparticle gap. In addition, we find that the decay length is
    roughly about 0.2 in units of the particle size for different nanoparticle
    size, shape, metal type, or medium dielectric constant. The near-exponential
    distance decay and the interesting "universal" scaling behavior of
    interparticle plasmon coupling can be qualitatively explained on
    the basis of a dipolar-coupling model as being due to the interplay
    of two factors: the direct dependence of the single-particle polarizability
    on the cubic power of the particle dimension and the decay of the
    plasmonic near-field as the cubic power of the inverse distance.
    Using this universal scaling behavior, we are able to derive a "plasmon
    ruler equation" that estimates the interparticle separation between
    Au nanospheres in a biological system from the observed fractional
    shift of the plasmon band. We find good agreement of the interparticle

  abstract = {The decay time of the luminescence of a molecule S in front of a metal
    mirror depends markedly on its distance from the mirror. This phenomenon
    is quantitatively explained by considering the radiation field of
    this dipole, given by Hertz classical equation. This field arrives
    at the molecule, after being reflected at the mirror, with a retardation
    of the order of 10-15 sec. The decay time of the luminescence depends
    on the phase shift produced by this retardation, and thus on the
    ratio of the distance of the oscillator from the mirror, and the
    wavelength of the emitted light. By measuring the distance dependence
    of the decay time of the luminescence this retardation effect can
    be studied. In quantum-mechanical terms the phenomenon can be described
    as being due to a stimulation or inhibition of the emission of the
    light quantum. In contrast to the known cases of stimulated emission,
    the stimulating field is the radiation field of the emitter quantum
    itself. The energy transfer from an excited molecule S to an acceptor
    A can be treated in a similar manner by considering the phenomenon
    as a retardation effect. In classical terms the field of S induces
    A to oscillate, and the induced field of A arriving at S slows down
    this oscillator. Simple equations are given for the energy transfer
    from an excited dipole or quadrupole, and for a row of many dipoles,
    oscillating in phase, to a weakly absorbing acceptor layer. The latter
    case is considered as a model for a J-aggregating dye and by comparison
    with experimental data conclusions concerning the size of a J aggregate
    are drawn.}

    properties. {E}xamples include the intense colors of noble metal
    colloids, surface plasmon resonance absorption by thin metal films,
    and quenching of excited fluorophores near the metal surfaces. {R}ecently,
    the interactions of fluorophores with metallic particles and surfaces
    (metals) have been used to obtain increased fluorescence intensities,
    to develop assays based on fluorescence quenching by gold colloids,
    and to obtain directional radiation from fluorophores near thin metal
    films. {F}or metal-enhanced fluorescence it is difficult to predict
    whether a particular metal structure, such as a colloid, fractal,
    or continuous surface, will quench or enhance fluorescence. {I}n
    the present report we suggest how the effects of metals on fluorescence
    can be explained using a simple concept, based on radiating plasmons
    ({RP}s). {T}he underlying physics may be complex but the concept
    is simple to understand. {A}ccording to the {RP} model, the emission
    or quenching of a fluorophore near the metal can be predicted from
    the optical properties of the metal structures as calculated from
    electrodynamics, {M}ie theory, and/or {M}axwell?s equations. {F}or
    example, according to {M}ie theory and the size and shape of the
    particle, the extinction of metal colloids can be due to either absorption
    or scattering. {I}ncident energy is dissipated by absorption. {F}ar-field
    radiation is created by scattering. {B}ased on our model small colloids
    are expected to quench fluorescence because absorption is dominant
    over scattering. {L}arger colloids are expected to enhance fluorescence
    because the scattering component is dominant over absorption. {T}he
    ability of a metal?s surface to absorb or reflect light is due to
    wavenumber matching requirements at the metal?sample interface. {W}avenumber
    matching considerations can also be used to predict whether fluorophores
    at a given distance from a continuous planar surface will be emitted
    or quenched. {T}hese considerations suggest that the so called ?lossy
    surface waves? which quench fluorescence are due to induced electron
    oscillations which cannot radiate to the far-field because wavevector
    matching is not possible. {W}e suggest that the energy from the fluorophores
    thought to be lost by lossy surface waves can be recovered as emission
    by adjustment of the sample to allow wavevector matching. {T}he {RP}
    model provides a rational approach for designing fluorophore?metal
    configurations with the desired emissive properties and a basis for
    nanophotonic fluorophore technology.}

  abstract = {Metallic surfaces can have unusual effects on fluorophores such as
    increasing or decreasing the rates of radiative decay and the rates
    of resonance energy transfer ({RET}). {I}n the present article we
    describe the effects of metallic silver island films on the emission
    spectra, lifetimes, and energy transfer for several fluorophores.
    {T}he fluorophores are not covalently coupled to the silver islands
    so that there are a range of fluorophore-to-metal distances. {W}e
    show that proximity of fluorophores to the silver islands results
    in increased fluorescence intensity, with the largest enhancement
    for the lowest-quantum-yield fluorophores. {I}mportantly, the metal-induced
    increases in intensity are accompanied by decreased lifetimes and
    increased photostability. {T}hese effects demonstrate that the silver
    islands have increased the radiative decay rates of the fluorophore.
    {F}or solvent-sensitive fluorophores the emission spectra shifted
    to shorted wavelengths in the presence of the silver islands, which
    is consistent with a decrease of the apparent lifetime for fluorophores
    near the metal islands. {W}e also observed an increased intensity
    and blue spectral shift for the protein human glyoxalase, which displays
    a low quantum yield for its intrinsic tryptophan emission. {I}n this
    case the blue shift is thought to be due to increased emission from
    a buried low-quantum-yield tryptophan residue. {I}ncreased intensities
    were also observed for the intrinsic emission of the nucleic acid
    bases adenine and thymine and for single-stranded 15-mers poly({T})
    and poly({C}). {A}nd finally, we observed increased {RET} for donors
    and acceptors in solution and when bound to double-helical {DNA}.
    {T}hese results demonstrate that metallic particles can be used to
    modify the emission from intrinsic and extrinsic fluorophores in

    or quenching of the fluorescence close to metal surfaces. We argue
    theoretically and demonstrate experimentally that under SEF conditions
    the plasmon resonances affect not only the fluorescence intensity
    (enhancement or quenching) but also its spectral profile, sometimes
    to a point where the original fluorescence spectrum may no longer
    be recognizable as such. Moreover, we argue that the modified excited-state
    decay rate may, under certain conditions, become comparable to the
    internal relaxation rate. This effect leads to a new fluorescence
    mechanism, which we call fast-dynamics SEF (FDSEF), where the spectral
    profile is affected by the relaxation dynamics in the excited state
    (in addition to the plasmon resonance). Finally, we propose that
    the so-called surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) continuum
    may, in many instances, be interpreted in terms of a SPM of the SEF
    (in its simplest form or as FDSEF). Experimental evidence using highly
    uniform nanolithography-prepared gold nanostructures are provided

    a two-dimensional transverse magnetic model is used for simulation,

    is simply divided into two stages, the excitation and the emission,

    another model, an electric dipole within the gap of the dimer, is

    The results show that a metallic dimer behaves as a nanolens to provide
    a strong local electric field in the gap to excite the molecule,

    Our results further suggest that the luminescence can be separated

    radiative recombination between the ground state and two distinctively
    different excited states takes place. The origin of the observed
    luminescence bands is discussed using a solid state as well as a

    information is combined with previously reported fluorescence lifetimes
    to deduce radiative and nonradiative decay rates. {A}long the alcohol
    series from methanol to octanol, rhodamine 6{G} displays an increasing
    radiative rate, in parallel with the square of the refractive index
    increase, and a slightly decreasing nonradiative rate. {F}luorescein
    is different: the apparent radiative rate actually decreases, suggesting
    that the emissive species is perturbed in some fashion. {F}or both

    in parallel with a corresponding increase in lifetimes. {P}rotonated
    solvents invariably give shorter lifetimes and lower quantum yields,

    yield of fluorescein in 0.1 {N} {N}a{OH}(aq) is 0.925 +- 0.015, and

    We show that the optimal nanosphere diameter for luminescence quantum
    efficiency enhancement associated with resonant coupling to plasmon
    modes is in the range of 30-110 nm, depending on the material properties.
    The optimal diameter is found to be a trade-off between (1) emitter-plasmon
    coupling, which is most effective for small spheres, and (2) the
    outcoupling of plasmons into radiation, which is most efficient for
    large spheres. In addition, we show that the well-known Gersten and
    Nitzan model does not describe the existence of a finite optimal
    diameter unless the model is extended with the correction factor
    for radiation damping. With this correction and a correction for
    dynamic depolarization, the mathematically simpler Gersten and Nitzan
    model provides a reasonably accurate approximation of the decay rate
    modifications associated with coupling to the dipole plasmon mode.
    We anticipate that the Gersten and Nitzan model in the form that
    we validate in this paper for spheres will allow the analytical investigation

  abstract = {A general overview of the optoelectronic properties of pi-conjugated
    polymers is presented. Two types of polymer are discerned: interchangeable
    structures of the same energy (degenerate), such as polyacetylene;
    and non-degenerate polymers, such as poly(para-phenylene). The band
    structures of degenerate and non-degenerate polymers are related
    to their conductivities in doped and non-doped states. In both cases,
    disorder and impurities play an important role in conductivity. Polarons,
    bipolarons and excitons are detailed with respect to doping and charge
    transfers. Given the fibrillic nature of these materials, the variable
    range hopping (VRH) law for semiconducting polymers is modified to
    account for metallic behaviours. Optoelectronic properties - electroluminescence
    and photovoltaic activity - are explained in terms of HOMO and LUMO
    bands, polaron-exciton and charge movement over one or more molecules.
    The properties of H- or J-type aggregates and their effects on transitions
    are related to target applications. Device structures of polymer
    light-emitting diodes are explicitly linked to optimising polaron
    recombinations and overall quantum efficiencies. The particularly
    promising use of ?-conjugated polymers in photovoltaic devices is
    discussed.},

    nanoparticles result in very much more effective SERS-active systems;
    the observed polarization sensitivity shown by nanoparticle aggregates;
    and the optical behavior of nanostructured metals in the absence

    electromagnetic model one can also understand the seminal features
    reported for single-molecule SERS, including the puzzling observation
    that only a few silver particles in an ensemble are hot (they are
    appropriately structured nanoparticle clusters) and that for a hot
    particle, once one is able to observe SERS, adding more adsorbate
    does not significantly alter the intensity (once the electromagnetic
    hot spot is occupied, adding adsorbate to other sites on the nanoparticle
    cluster will not add greatly to the observed intensity). However,
    the electromagnetic model does not account for all that is learned
    through SERS. Molecular resonances, charge-transfer transitions and
    other processes such as ballistic electrons transiently probing the
    region where the molecule resides and then modulating electronic
    processes of the metal as a result certainly contribute to the rich
    information SERS reports; and by virtue of the fact that these contributions
    will vary from molecule to molecule, they will constitute the most
    interesting aspects reported by SERS. But, the overall reason why
    SERS produces such inordinate enhancements is largely an electromagnetic

    that is at times a millionfold more intense than expected. {T}his
    effect was dubbed surface-enhanced {R}aman scattering ({SERS}). {S}ince
    then the effect has been demonstrated with many molecules and with
    a number of metals, including {C}u, {A}g, {A}u, {L}i, {N}a, {K},
    {I}n, {P}t, and {R}h. {I}n addition, related phenomena such as surface-enhanced
    second-harmonic generation, four-wave mixing, absorption, and fluorescence
    have been observed. {A}lthough not all fine points of the enhancement
    mechanism have been clarified, the majority view is that the largest
    contributor to the intensity amplification results from the electric
    field enhancement that occurs in the vicinity of small, interacting
    metal particles that are illuminated with light resonant or near
    resonant with the localized surface-plasmon frequency of the metal
    structure. {S}mall in this context is gauged in relation to the wavelength

    which include among other techniques electrochemical oxidation-reduction
    cycling, deposition of metal on very cold substrates, and the generation
    of metal-island films and colloids, is now understood to be necessary
    as a means of producing surfaces with appropriate electromagnetic
    resonances that may couple to electromagnetic fields either by generating
    rough films (as in the case of the former two examples) or by placing
    small metal particles in close proximity to one another (as in the
    case of the latter two). {F}or molecules chemisorbed on {SERS}-active
    surface there exists a "chemical enhancement" in addition to the
    electromagnetic effect. {A}lthough difficult to measure accurately,
    the magnitude of this effect rarely exceeds a factor of 10 and is
    best thought to arise from the modification of the {R}aman polarizability
    tensor of the adsorbate resulting from the formation of a complex
    between the adsorbate and the metal. {R}ather than an enhancement
    mechanism, the chemical effect is more logically to be regarded as
    a change in the nature and identity of the adsorbate.}

    glutathione (GSH), were prepared by reductive decomposition of Au(I)-SG
    polymers at a low temperature and separated into a number of fractions
    by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Chemical compositions
    of the fractionated clusters determined previously by electrospray
    ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (Negishi, Y. et al. J. Am. Chem.
    Soc. 2004, 126, 6518) were reassessed by taking advantage of freshly
    prepared samples, higher mass resolution, and more accurate mass
    calibration; the nine smallest components are reassigned to Au10(SG)10,
    Au15(SG)13, Au18(SG)14, Au22(SG)16, Au22(SG)17, Au25(SG)18, Au29(SG)20,
    Au33(SG)22, and Au39(SG)24. These assignments were further confirmed
    by measuring the mass spectra of the isolated Au:S(h-G) clusters,
    where h-GSH is a homoglutathione. It is proposed that a series of
    the isolated Au:SG clusters corresponds to kinetically trapped intermediates
    of the growing Au cores. The relative abundance of the isolated clusters
    was correlated well with the thermodynamic stabilities against unimolecular
    decomposition. The electronic structures of the isolated Au:SG clusters
    were probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and optical
    spectroscopy. The Au(4f) XPS spectra illustrate substantial electron
    donation from the gold cores to the GS ligands in the Au:SG clusters.
    The optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra indicate that
    the electronic structures of the Au:SG clusters are well quantized;
    embryos of the sp band of the bulk gold evolve remarkably depending
    on the number of the gold atoms and GS ligands. The comparison of
    these spectral data with those of sodium Au(I) thiomalate and 1.8
    nm Au:SG nanocrystals (NCs) reveals that the subnanometer-sized Au
    clusters thiolated constitute a distinct class of binary system which
    lies between the Au(I)-thiolate complexes and thiolate-protected
    Au NCs.}

  abstract = {Abstract: The optical properties of metallic nanoshell dimers are
    investigated using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method.
    We discuss issues of numerical convergence specific for the dimer
    system. We present results for both homodimers and heterodimers.
    The results show that retardation effects must be taken into account
    for an accurate description of realistic size nanoparticle dimers.
    The optical properties of the nanoshell dimer are found to be strongly
    polarization dependent. Maximal coupling between the nanoshells in
    a dimer occurs when the electric field of the incident pulse is aligned
    parallel to the dimer axis. The wavelengths of the peaks in the extinction
    cross section of the dimer are shown to vary by more than 100 nm,
    depending on the incident electric field polarization. The calculations
    show that electric field enhancements in the dimer junctions depend
    strongly on dimer separation. The maximum field enhancements occur
    in the dimer junction and at the expense of a reduced electric field
    enhancement in other regions of space. We investigate the usefulness
    of nanoshell dimers substrates for SERS by integrating the fourth
    power of the electric field enhancements around the surfaces of the
    nanoparticles as a function of dimer separation and wavelength. The
    SERS efficiency is shown to depend strongly on dimer separation but
    much weaker than the fourth power of the maximum electric field enhancement
    at a particular point. The SERS efficiency is also found to depend
    strongly on the wavelength of the incident light. Maximum SERS efficiency
    occurs for resonant excitation of the dimer plasmons.},

    is determined by the interplay between Landau damping and underscreening

  abstract = {This paper presents calculations of the electronic polarizabilities
    of very small metallic particles and of very thin metallic films.
    {T}he theoretical model we employ for the metallic particle is simply
    that of {N} free electrons trapped by an infinitely deep spherical
    potential well. {T}he model used for the thin-film problem is that
    of a system of free electrons constrained to move in the volume enclosed
    by two infinite parallel planes. {L}inear-response theory and {P}oisson's
    equation are used to calculate the electronic polarizability in terms
    of the electronic density-density response function. {T}he numerical
    results provide an idea of just how small, or how thin, a small metallic
    particle, or thin metallic film, has to be for it to begin to lose
    its bulk property of being able to screen an externally applied electric

  abstract = {Some unique events have occurred in the last few years which might
    revolutionize the field of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. While
    it was widely recognized that such matrices could normally be cast
    with a small pore size distribution, typically of the order of a
    few nanometers diameter (for protein sieving), recent developments
    suggest that "macroporous" gels could also be produced in the domain
    of polyacrylamides. If constraints to chain motion are imposed during
    gel polymerization, large-pore structures can be grown. Such constraints
    can originate either from low temperatures or from the presence of
    preformed polymers in the gelling solution; in both cases, the growing
    chains are forced to "laterally aggregate" via inter-chain hydrogen
    bond formation. Upon consumption of pendant double bonds, such bundles
    are frozen in the three-dimensional space by permanent cross-links.
    As an additional development, a novel photopolymerization system
    is described, comprising a cationic dye (methylene blue) and a redox
    couple (sodium toluene sulfinate, a reducer, and diphenyliodonium
    chloride, a mild oxidizer). Methylene blue catalysis is characterized
    by a unique efficiency, ensuring>96% conversion of monomers, even
    in hydro-organic solvents and in the presence of surfactants, which
    normally quench or completely inhibit the persulphate-driven reaction.
    In addition, methylene blue-sustained photopolymerization can be
    operated in the entire pH 3-10 interval, where most other systems
    fail. Perhaps the most striking novelty in the field is the appearance
    of a novel monomer (N-acryloylaminopropanol, AAP) coupling a high
    hydrophilicity with a unique resistance to alkaline hydrolysis. Given
    the fact that a poly(AAP) matrix is 500 times more stable than a
    poly(acrylamide) gel, while being twice as hydrophilic, it is anticipated
    that this novel chemistry will have no difficulties in replacing
    the old electrophoretic anticonvective media. The review ends with
    a glimpse at novel sieving media in capillary zone electrophoresis:
    polymer networks. Such media, by providing an almost infinite range
    of pore sizes, due to the absence of a rigid support, allow sieving
    mechanisms to be operative over a wide interval of particle sizes,
    even up to genomic DNA. Viscous solutions of polymer networks, made
    with the novel poly(AAP) chemistry, allow repeated use of the same
    separation column, well above 50 injections. Silica-bound poly(AAP)
    chains provide effective quenching of electrosmosis and>200 analyses
    by isoelectric focusing.}

    near and beyond the limit where the particles are touching. As the
    particles approach each other, a dominant dipole feature is observed
    that is pushed into the infrared due to interparticle coupling and
    that is associated with a large pileup of induced charge in the interparticle
    gap. The redshift becomes singular as the particle separation decreases.
    The response weakens for very small separation when the coupling
    across the interparticle gap becomes so strong that dipolar oscillations
    across the pair are inhibited. Lowerwavelength, higher-order modes
    show a similar separation dependence in nearly touching dimers. After
    touching, singular behavior is observed through the emergence of
    a new infrared absorption peak, also accompanied by huge charge pileup
    at the interparticle junction, if initial interparticle-contact is
    made at a single point. This new mode is distinctly different from
    the lowest mode of the separated dimer. When the junction is made
    by contact between flat surfaces, charge at the junction is neutralized
    and mode evolution is continuous through contact. The calculated

    but are highly water soluble. The most abundant cluster produced
    by these methods can be easily separated from its homologues by gel
    electrophoresis. Its total molecular weight is ca. 10.4 kDa, and
    the mass of its strongly bound inorganic core is 5.6 kDa, suggesting
    the composition Au28(SG)16. This composition is also consistent with
    the X-ray diffraction pattern of the crystalline molecular solid.
    Distinct features in the optical absorption spectroscopy are inherently
    different from either larger clusters or smaller gold cluster compounds.
    The compound is optically active, as evidenced by circular dichroism
    in the near-IR, visible, and near-UV regions. The 13C NMR spectra
    suggest that the bonding environment of the GS-adsorbate is similar
    to that of the n-alkyl-adsorbate clusters, and the nonsulfhydryl
    properties are retained. The cluster is thus envisioned as a large
    metallic-cluster compound with distinctive optical properties encapsulated
    by a bioactive peptide monolayer.},

    film consisting of metal granules randomly distributed on an insulating

    and consist of strongly localized sharp peaks. In peaks (hot spots),
    the local fields exceed the applied field by several orders of magnitudes
    resulting in giant enhancements of the optical nonlinearities. Because
    of such a pattern for the local field distributions, the nonlinear
    signals are mostly generated from small nanometer-size areas. The
    corresponding spatial distributions for the generated fields form,
    in turn, a set of very sharp peaks on a homogeneous, on average,
    semicontinuous film. It is shown that the spatial positions of the
    localized hot spots at the fundamental and generated frequencies
    are located, in general, in different parts of a film. The local
    enhancements in the hot spots exceed the average enhancement by several
    orders of magnitude. The predicted giant local enhancements open
    fascinating possibilities in nonlinear spectroscopy of single molecules
    on a semicontinuous metal film. A number of surface-enhanced optical
    nonlinearities are studied, namely, those that are responsible for
    the Kerr-effect, four-wave mixing, second-, and third-harmonic generation.
    The enhancement for nonlinear optical processes is shown to strongly
    increase toward the long-wavelength part of the spectrum. Spatial
    distributions of the local fields are calculated in our broad-scale
    numerical simulations. A scaling theory for the high-order field
    moments is developed. It predicts that the moments of the local fields
    are very large and independent of the frequency in a wide spectral
    range. The theory predicts anomalous field fluctuations and giant
    enhancements for the nonlinear optical processes, from the visible
    to the far-infrared spectral range.},

    biotin (Bio) and some Bio analogues [Biotin methyl ester (MEBio),
    desthiobiotin (DEBio), 2?-iminobiotin (IMBio), and diaminobiotin
    (DABio)] were recorded. The vibrational results indicate that the
    interaction with some of these ligands is able to modify the overall
    structure of the protein and this binding results in a decrease in
    the &bgr;sheet content and an increase in the &agr;-helix content.
    To further confirm the conformational changes of the protein structure
    due to Bio analogue binding, the curve-fitting analysis of the amide
    I Raman band of neat Strep and of the complexes were performed. The
    intensity ratio of the components due to the &bgr;-sheet and &agr;-helix
    conformations decreased in the Strep-MEBio, Strep-IMBio (pH 11),
    and Strep-Bio systems, whereas in all the other systems the changes
    were not significant. This behavior differs from that of Avi bound
    to the same ligands and suggests that Strep and Avi differ in their
    binding selectivity. A good correlation was found between the secondary
    structure percentages of the Avi and of the Strep complexes and &Dgr;G°.
    On the basis of this linear relationship, the vibrational results
    allow for an acceptable evaluation of the dissociation constants
    of the Strep complexes, not previously reported in the literature.
    The present results indicate a correlation between the type of interaction
    and the effects of the protein-substrate bonding on the overall structure
    of the proteins. The amino acid residues in the binding site appear
    to be positioned in a such a way as to provide a precise fit of Bio.
    Even slight change in the substrate structure causes a weakness in
    the strength of the binding. The vibrational results confirm that
    both the imidazolidinone and the thiophan rings are important in
    the Strep-Bio interactions, but the former is more responsible for
    the high affinity of the binding. One of the Tyr residues is hydrogen
    bound with the ureido ring and another Tyr could be involved in the
    binding pocket. Trp residues do not directly bind the ligand and
    probably stabilize other binding site residues which in turn interact
    directly with Bio.}

    straightening the molecule; the other consistent with extension of
    the polypeptide chain in the PEVK region. On a slower timescale and
    above a certain force threshold, the molecule displays stress-relaxation,
    which occurs in rapid steps of a few piconewtons, corresponding to
    yielding of internal structures by about 20 nm. This stress-relaxation

    In addition, the overall fluorescence rate which includes the enhancement

    that for particles of very small sizes (<10 nm), the nonlocal effects,
    in general, lead to significantly greater fluorescence rates and
    smaller nonradiative decay rates for the admolecules, with the effects
    on radiative rates depending crucially on the orientation of the
    molecules. Furthermore, the effects are mostly noticeable for molecules
    close to the metal particle and in processes where higher multipolar
    interactions are significant such as those in nonradiative decay

    of the DNA hairpin probe sequence to detect a specific target DNA
    sequence of interest. In the absence of target DNA, the stem-loop
    configuration maintains the Raman label in proximity to the metal
    nanoparticle, inducing an intense surface-enhanced Raman scattering
    (SERS) effect that produces a strong Raman signal upon laser excitation.
    Upon hybridization of a complementary target DNA sequence to the
    nanoprobe, the stem-loop configuration is disrupted, causing the
    Raman label to physically separate from the metal nanoparticle, thus
    quenching the SERS signal. The usefulness and potential application
    of the plasmonics nanoprobe for diagnosis is demonstrated using the

  abstract = {We present a comprehensive solution to the classical problem of electromagnetic
    scattering by aggregates of an arbitrary number of arbitrarily configured
    spheres that are isotropic and homogeneous but may be of different
    size and composition. The profile of incident electromagnetic waves
    is arbitrary. The analysis is based on the framework of the Mie theory
    for a single sphere and the existing addition theorems for spherical
    vector wave functions. The classic Mie theory is generalized. Applying
    the extended Mie theory to all the spherical constituents in an aggregate
    simultaneously leads to a set of coupled linear equations in the
    unknown interactive coefficients. We propose an asymptotic iteration
    technique to solve for these coefficients. The total scattered field
    of the entire ensemble is constructed with the interactive scattering
    coefficients by the use of the translational addition theorem a second
    time. Rigorous analytical expressions are derived for the cross sections
    in a general case and for all the elements of the amplitude-scattering
    matrix in a special case of a plane-incident wave propagating along
    the z axis. As an illustration, we present some of our preliminary
    numerical results and compare them with previously published laboratory
    scattering measurements.}

    a rigorous solution and the discrete-dipole approximation (DDA) for
    two-sphere aggregates. We also compare theoretical predictions with
    laboratory scattering measurements to examine the validity of the
    numerical solutions. It is found that there are cases in which the
    DDA solution, while satisfying the validity criterion for interdipole
    spacing to be small compared with the wavelength of incident radiation,
    deviates significantly from the rigorous solution and the experimental
    results. We show that the DDA works reasonably well for small-volume
    structures and that its validity is challenged, at least as it is
    currently implemented, when used on larger structures. We also show
    that, besides its advantages in reliability, the rigorous solution
    approach is far superior to the approximation method in computing
    efficiency as well.}

    Prior to exchange reactions with alkanethiols, however, no luminescence
    was observed with the gold particles, Au11Cl3(PPh3)7. This was interpreted,
    at least in part, by the effect of ligand fields on the electronic

    with that of the traditional citrate-reduced gold colloid was evaluated
    by {HC}l titration, cyanide etching, and seeded growth tests. {T}he
    modified gold nanoparticles show an improved stability against p{H}
    changes and cyanide etching. {T}hey do show further growth, which
    appears to be more homogeneous than for the unmodified particles.}

  abstract = {We have measured the temperature driven denaturing, or melting transition
    in poly d({A})-poly d({T}) {DNA} oligomers of various lengths in
    different buffer conditions. {O}ur findings are in clear disagreement
    with two state, reaction kinetics model, and we find that the so-called
    zipper model, where denaturing proceeds through opening of the duplex
    at the ends describes well the temperature dependence of the average
    number of open base pairs. {A}nalysis of the length dependence of
    the transition parameters however suggest that bubble formation is
    important and that the transition, in the thermodynamic limit, is
    continuous, albeit close to first order.}

  title = {Training Manual on Gracilaria Culture and Seaweed Processing in China},
  organization = {FAO - Fisheries and Aquaculture Department},
  year = {1990},
  abstract = {Gracilaria is a group of warm water seaweeds. There are more than
    one hundred species in the world, some of which have very important
    economic value. Gracilaria is used as food and in the preparation
    of food products. It is also an important raw material in agar-agar
    production. At present, the world's annual output of Gracilaria is
    about 30,000 tons, dry weight, most of which comes from natural production.
    For example, the natural production in Chile, Argentina, and Brazil
    accounts for one third of this total output. With the increasing
    demand for Gracilaria, greater attention has been focused on the
    development of its artificial culture by many countries, especially
    those in Southeast Asia. China is the earliest country that artificially
    cultured Gracilaria. Today, the culture area in South China is about
    2,000 ha producing 3,000 tons dried material annually. Taiwan produces
    1,000 tons dried Gracilaria yearly from 400 hectares under cultivation.
    Nowadays, Gracilaria is cultured mainly using the following methods:
    bottom culture, raft culture, stake-rope culture and pond culture.
    Pond culture can be divided into two systems, monoculture and polyculture
    with shrimp and other species. The varieties of culture methods can
    be adapted for different areas. In view of the importance of Gracilaria
    as a seafarming commodity, the National Coordinators of the Regional
    Seafarming Project recommended the dissemination of its culture and
    processing technology, through a regional training and demonstration
    activity, as a means to further increase the opportunities to develop
    the seafarming industry of the region.},
